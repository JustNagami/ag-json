Based on earth, Gaea's system is unable to handle such vast data and is collapsing... \n\nThe focus of our next attempt is stability... We don't have much time left, our immune systems have been weakened by the overload of work, and intense radiation is damaging our bodies. But, for the sake of humanity's future, we can't give up so easily. \n\nFor the fourth attempt, we optimized Gaea's system database. The world's stability was observed by us using the \"deviation rate\", we were confident we could keep it running with only deviating above or below 2%. \n\n\"The system didn't collapse, and people could live peacefully in the Gaia world, with society developing orderly, just as we envisioned. But the good times didn't last, people born with past memories refused to submit to Gaea's rule. Chaos began to spread - this is not the future we desired.\" \n\nSome of the researchers withdrew, and the plan fell apart due to the lack of manpower. We can't get caught up with being humane... \n\n In the fifth attempt, we have formatted the volunteers' memories, making most of them directly forget about their memories recorded in Gaea. I have no other choice... \n\n \"At the end of the observation period, we find that the system runs smoothly, and the deviation rate is controlled within 1%, allowing us to make bolder adjustments. We have successfully turned the world of Gaea into a doomsday shelter, and the government has finalized their decisions after conducting multiple tests. The Gaea immigration project will commence next week.\"\n\n For this last week, we will continue to optimize the idealbild and system reset safeguards, even though I don't think there's much chance of using them. \n\nThe government has issued special permits, allowing us to keep retaining our memories when we enter into Gaea, this is a special honor as Gaea developers. But I don't think I'll make it to that day... \n\nA final check of the system has only yielded small issues, but seeing that they were caused by a large amount of consciousnesses being transferred over to the world this year, Gaea should be able to deal with it itself. \n\nTo ensure system security, no one can interfere with the operation of Gaea except for them. The government's considerations are understandable, regardless of some anxiety that we may have. Moreover, the development of the patch codenamed \u2018Modifier' has exceeded expectations. Even with external manipulation, it may not handle Gaea's current system properly. \n\nWe can leave with peace of mind...\n",

During his operations, he also discovered a military-grade AGI Mecha blueprint that had been hidden by the Spealght technical department. \n\nThis military - grade AGI Mecha was initially designed along a whole new movement structure that also incorporated state-of-the-art artificial intelligence technology during its manufacturing process resulting in a mecha that is capable of easily handling various complex battle situations. Its mobility has surpassed all current military-grade AGI Mechas, with the army being able to just rely on the power of one mecha to dominate the battlefield. \n\nThis AGI Mecha design was proposed by CORG's top brass, claiming that this AGI Mecha would only be used as \"a peace-keeping measure when absolutely necessary\". But during its development, Spealght's engineers discovered that it was vastly superior in standard, far exceeding the scope of human weapons. The management at Spealght thus discreetly buried this document. \n\nIn fact, this is just what CORG manufactured - a specialized AGI Mecha to counter the Visbane. However, after testing the prototype they were given, CORG's technical department discovered that the entirely code-reliant AGI Mecha was extremely vulnerable to the Visbane's corrosion. Upon being corrupted, the AGI Mecha became highly aggressive and uncontrollable, even attacking humans. \n\nCORG promptly halted this research, destroying the prototype and sealing all related data. To reduce the probability of subsequent AGI Mecha being corrupted by the Visbane, CORG enforced technical restrictions to compel Spealght Industries to modify their production lines. Later, CORG found that only modifiers with complete personality consciousness could stably fight the Visbane. Thus, they turned to the implementation of Project Graytower - an attempt to create artificial modifiers. And the batch of partly finished AGI Mecha with terrifying destructive potential gradually gathered dust in a corner of the Spealght factory. \n\nHowever, Ethan, who unexpectedly obtained the design document, was unaware of this hidden and dangerous history. He was amazed by the immense power of these military-grade AGI Mechas, and in an attempt to bring this miraculous technology onto the world once more, he used the stolen AGI Mecha components from the Spealght factory, and using the documents as references, was able to assemble a giant AGI Mecha. He named it \"Dark Metal\" after the name in the technical document he read...\n",
