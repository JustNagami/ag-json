But, for the sake of humanity's future, we can't give up so easily.\n\nFor the fourth attempt, we optimized Gaea's system database.

But the good times didn't last, people born with past memories refused to submit to Gaea's rule. Chaos began to spread. This is not the future we desired.\"\n\nSome of the researchers withdrew, and the plan fell apart due to the lack of manpower. We can't get caught up with being humane...\n\nIn the fifth attempt, we have formatted the volunteers' memories, making most of them directly forget about their memories recorded in Gaea.

But I don't think I'll make it to that day...\n\nA final check of the system has only yielded small issues, but seeing that they were caused by a large amount of consciousnesses being transferred over to the world this year, Gaea should be able to deal with it itself.\n\nTo ensure system security, no one can interfere with the operation of Gaea except for them. The government's considerations are understandable, regardless of some anxiety that we may have. Moreover, the development of the patch codenamed 'Modifier' has exceeded expectations.

Its power system far exceeded the ceiling of military AGI Mechas at the time, allowing a single mecha to dominate the battlefield.\n\nThe design had been requested by CORG executives, who said the machine would be used as a \"peaceful measure when necessary\", but during the development process, Spealght technicians discovered that its real intended application was to outperform all other human weaponry, and that was why the Spealght leadership had decided to hide the technical documents.\n\nCORG achieved its aim, producing an AGI Mecha that would rival the Visbanes. However, after delivering the prototype, CORG technicians found that the mecha's code was highly vulnerable to Visbane attacks, after which the mecha might become wild and uncontrollable, or could even attack humans.\n\nCORG quickly called a halt to the project, destroyed the prototype, and sealed away the related documents. In order to reduce the likelihood of future Visbane corruption, CORG disallowed similar technology to be produced, forcing Spealght Industries to modify its production lines. After some time, CORG discovered that only Modifiers with fully personalized consciousnesses could fight against Visbanes reliably. This led to Project Graytower—an attempt to produce artificial Modifiers. And that batch of half-finished AGI Mechas with terrifying destructive power was left to be forgotten in a dusty corner of the Spealght Factory.\n\nHaving stumbled upon the designs, Ethan was unaware of this hidden and dangerous history. Shocked by the AGI Mecha's firepower and driven to see it come to life, he looted spare components from the Spealght Factory and referred to the designs to construct a massive mecha, then named it according to the code name in the documents: Dark Metal...\n",

IDOL is mainly for customizing AI idols. But what is AI customization? I'm sure everyone's familiar with AI by now. But what's the customization part all about? That's what we'll be discussing below. \n\nIDOL's AI idol customization is actually a process whereby the user freely makes aesthetic and personality adjustments to create their ideal idol character. After this, they can put on all sorts of performances in the IDOL community's entertainment industry to get subscriptions and gifts from other users.\n\nAdditionally, IDOL allows users to make tweaks before their solo streaming room performances. By taking advantage of this feature, plenty of users have been able to both create the perfect idol and the ideal companion, as well as enjoy time alone with their creation.\n\nThe success of IDOL's custom idols is owed to the company's breakthrough AI technology, which allows for even more flexible, lifelike AI. They can engage so smoothly in back and forth conversation while keeping with the character they've been customized with, it's almost like they really exist.\n\nSo, I'm sure what we're all wondering is just how IDOL Group's AI personalities are able to achieve such authenticity. IDOL Group's AI personalities are so true to life that it may surprise you. But they really are, I was shocked myself. Is anyone else just amazed by IDOL's custom AI idols?\n\nDid you have any thoughts have reading this? You're welcome to discuss it with me in the comments.\n\n—Top comments—\n\nUser43211451: These marketing accounts are so out of touch. Just give up.\n\n",

        "desc": "Elos Hotel Case Closed? \n—Excerpt from The Molander Record's report\n\n\"The curtain has finally closed on the incident at Elos Hotel that sent shockwaves through Gaea. After a lengthy investigation, CORG has finally uncovered the truth behind this bizarre case.\" \n\n\"It all began a few months ago, when a tourist on vacation mysteriously disappeared from Elos Hotel, only for their body to be discovered two days later by a channel in the suburbs...\"\n\n\"A series of odd occurrences prior to the disappearance was captured on the hotel's security cameras. This footage was released to the public, garnering widespread attention. Despite a massive search operation coordinated by CORG, no trace of the tourist was found.\" \n\n\"In the security footage, the tourist can be seen walking from the dining room to their deluxe suite—their eyes glowing with an eerie blue light. In response to the footage, however, Dr. Rice, a professor of medicine, indicated that this is in fact a rare genetic disorder that causes acute pain and visual impairment. It's been recorded in...\"\n\n\"What follows is CORG's reconstructed timeline of events.\" \n\n\"On April 18th, 2315 at 8:17 PM, 34-year-old Mr. Peters checked into the hotel.\" \n\n\"On his way back to his room after eating, Peters began to experience ocular discomfort accompanied by a burning sensation. He then entered the observation elevator, which was under maintenance at the time.\" \n\n\"Failing to notice the maintenance sign, Peters entered an elevator CCTV blind spot and tragically slipped and fell.\" \n\n\"Due to fire code negligence, the hotel's basement was flooded with wastewater. The sewer shaft, which is connected to the elevator pit, carried his body from the cesspool to the treatment channel.\" \n\n\"CORG will cordon off the area around the channel, with restrictions placed on access by civilians...\"\n\n\"The conclusion of this previously unsolved case has revealed the truth of this unusual incident to the public. CORG's reconstructed timeline of events, however, seems to only raise more questions. With more in-depth research, we may be able to reveal more secrets of the paranormal, opening up new frontiers for humanity's scientists to explore...\"\n\n",

        "desc": "Title: Beware of Scams Posing as Custom AI!\nPosted by: @SafeMolander\n\nA few days ago, the police busted a custom AI scam. Preying on young people's desire for simple, easy interpersonal relationships, the grifters used IDOL Group's custom AI algorithm to dupe them into sending money and purchasing shoddy interactive products.\n\nIn their investigation, the police discovered that the racket is highly structured and extremely well organized.\n\nCustom order requests are first carried out by a \"customization expert\" through the IDOL app's customization feature, which is then shared with the victim in a private streaming room. Once the victim becomes attached to the AI model, they revoke the victim's access to the live stream and then persuade them in a private chat to download a fraudulent app.\n\nThen in the fraudulent app, the racket's \"programmers\" copy the customized AI data made by the \"customization expert\" and write code to encourage the victim to send money. As soon as the victim is unable to make further payments, the AI service is terminated.\n\nUnlike more traditional scams that pose as online gambling or dating, custom AI takes advantage of the mental state of today's youth. Even more insidiously, this scam preys on victims' emotions to extort money from them, all without ever tipping them off to the scam. Some of these custom AI apps even claim to make models of real people, when in fact they use the image, video, and audio files uploaded by users to crack face and voice recognition locks. This is a serious threat to the security of Molander residents' personal information and property.\n\nHaving failed to fulfill its supervisory and management responsibilities, IDOL Group has been ordered to delist itself until it can address the oversights that allowed this incident to take place. On that note, the police are once again urging the general public to raise their awareness of fraud prevention and to be wary of new AI technology scams!\n\n",

A total of 37 students were absent or excused from last week's class. Attendance was below 60% and fewer than 40% of after-class assignments were submitted.\n\n31 lab reports and literature research assignments are still awaiting your corrections. Kindly confirm and complete your feedback by 14:00 this afternoon.\n\nAs for what transpired yesterday evening in the cafeteria, please accept my deepest condolences. Should you require it, I've compiled a list of well-reviewed restaurants in Molander for your reference.\n\nYou're also welcome to use the communal kitchens in the faculty dormitories, but please mind the ceiling smoke detectors to avoid accidents.\n\nWishing you a speedy recovery and an enjoyable exchange visit.\n\nSincerely,\nIrena Kerr\n\n",

According to the developers, this means that users can train a virtual voice actor from scratch rather than use pre-existing audio recordings from any voice actor.\n\nWhere the public expressed excitement, the dubbing industry voiced profound criticism and concern.\n\n\"This is opening a Pandora's box.\" \n\nA celebrated dubbing director offered this categorical conclusion during an interview.\n\n\"My concern is that it will ultimately render any dubbed work soulless.\" \n\nBut what is the \"soul\" of dubbing? The director didn't offer a clear answer.\n\nThe only clear trend at the moment is that the number of radio dramas, audio books, and virtual anchors online has been growing exponentially. And now, the \"fully voice-acted game\"—which used to mean high-cost investment—is no longer a luxury, but a universal standard for the games market.\n\nOn the other hand, according to related market research, although the vast majority of story-driven games on the market offer high-quality voice acting, the percentage of players who skip these cutscenes entirely is on the rise. And what do gamers themselves think of the in-game dubbing provided by \"Miss Next-gen Broadcaster?\" Find out in the next \"The Last Solemn Observer of the New Age.\"\n\nContributor: Columnist_HeartIsle (AI Writer)\n\n",

In the time it takes to upload test data and images and wait for the analysis results, I often think about how hard a time I'd have as a socially anxious doctor in an era when doctors had to put a stethoscope to a patient's chest and a tongue depressor in their mouth.\n\n\"Incurable diseases\" seem like an increasingly distant concept to people now—at least to people living in the luxury high-rises on Core City's west coast. Today in Ain Soph, as long as you have the money, you can steer clear of any ailment.\n\nNot that I think this means that the development of medical technology has reached such lofty heights. Take \"localized amnesia\" for example—this condition has even specialist medical teams stumped, and the number of cases has risen significantly in recent years. Patients often claim that, try as they might, they just have no recollection of specific time periods. Even more baffling is the high degree of overlap in those time periods between different patients.\n\n...What could be causing this?\n\n",

        "desc": "\n\nThoth has had plenty of experience battling Visbanes. But never before has she felt so lost.\n\nShe has zero idea what the enemy is, nor whom she's fighting. The only thing she and her team are left to confront is this massive space rift big enough to destroy the whole of Molander city. The rift is of source unknown and unclear working principle. Expected trajectory of development: also a mystery. It's as beyond reason as extreme weather and natural disasters.\n\n\"Problems beyond reason should of course be resolved by people without reason. Isn't that why I've been sent here?\" The person next to Thoth pats her on the shoulder, then steps in front of her like she's cutting in line. A head of fiery red hair comes into view, like molten iron that hasn't yet cooled and solidified. \"Just do whatever it is you're supposed to, Captain Thoth.\" \n\n\"...Lokken, do you know what you have to do?\" \n\n\"Who knows? I wouldn't be here had you been able to find anything in those voluminous operation records of yours to help you right now.\" Lokken goes into a great big stretch, but there's no emotion written on her face. It's like she's just watched a really boring sporting event that has fizzled out at halftime. \"Director Paracaesar says that this thing is fundamentally a space rift, which means that once it meets with enough energy it'll naturally close. Sounds simple, doesn't it?\" Lokken looks back at the line of CORG soldiers working the data wall generators hundreds of meters away from them, then shrugs at Thoth. \"I suppose we can at least contain the effects of this rift? Goodness forbid that someone comes around and blames me for any casualties... Hang on, that wouldn't happen, would it? I mean... No one knows me. Yup. Nobody does.\" \n\n\"Everyone will... I assure you. Everyone will.\" \n\nLokken looks back at Thoth in surprise, waves her hand, and says with a smile, \"I was just joking. You didn't think I was hesitating, did you? Tools should know their purpose. That's how the tool passed QC in the first place... I'm off. Stay back.\" \n\nI'm off.\n\nThe two words hang with the gravest of weight between Thoth and Lokken. After the fact, Thoth can't quite remember what happened, as if it had nothing to do with her... or maybe it really had nothing to do with her. It was Lokken's battle, and she was just a spectator, the kind of \"spectator\" she least wanted to be.\n\nThoth hadn't known Lokken for very long, let alone had a close relationship with her, and at first, like everyone else, she even felt the latter to be an unreasonable weirdo who was simply impossible to get along with.\n\nBut is there really any life in this world that is inherently abominable and not worth preserving? Even if there really was such life, it probably wouldn't be her. After all, she was an \"Artificial Mod,\" born with the noble mission of ending the Visbane scourge, who'd never destroy anything related to humans. That was the rule.\n\n\"Tools should know their purpose,\" she'd said. But is that the sole reason she was born into this world?\n\nThe savage Divine Grace storm explodes along with the energy circuit maintaining the space rift. Then, it all settles down within the boundaries of the data wall. As Thoth recovers her senses, she instinctively loosens her grip, for she is no longer able to hold on.\n\nA heavy object comes crashing onto the ground. Thoth wipes the blood from her mouth and looks down toward the source of the sound. She visually scans the metal pipes exposed under Lokken's broken body for a while, and finally finds the most important part.\n\n\"Oh, the core is still intact...?\" Thoth heaves a sigh of relief, but then quickly sees the utter absurdity of the scene before her. She shakes her head vigorously and lets out a soft chuckle. \"Damn... just what is this craziness I've been up to?\" \n\n\"...But I suppose it all went well in the end. At least now I have something I can see and hold...\"\n\nThoth lifts up Lokken's body, and thinks over the feasibility of trying to move with the latter in her arms for a few seconds. Then, she pulls up her communicator, which thankfully wasn't damaged in the explosion, spends another few seconds thinking of a name, then dials their number.\n\n\"What's up, my author? I'm just getting the hang of things here at Meruism, and I'm up to my eyeballs in work. Whatever it is you have to say, make it quick.\" \n\n\"...Hello? Hello??? Am I actually through?!\" \n\n\"Huh? Why would you try calling me if you didn't think the call would go through...? And are you alright? Why do you sound so sickly?\" \n\n\"I'm alright...\" That she connected wasn't particularly great luck by any means, but Thoth feels a deep sense of inexplicable relief nevertheless. Everything is going to be alright. \"Do you need more hands on deck over there by any chance? I've got someone real obedient and useful over here if you do.\" \n\n",

It's a very straightforward form of mapping in this relationship. The smarter ones among us would've understood this before we stopped wetting our beds.\" \n\n\"Put simply, the relationship between the Plane Layer and the Surface Layer in the hyperspace experiment is the same, except that the mapping method and logic here are a little more complicated.\" \n\n\"Of course, everyone here, including Director Paracaesar, has been with the hyperspace development project at least 60% of the way, and the purpose of this briefing today is not to repeat what we already know...\"\n\nThe speaker, a man in a white lab coat, doesn't seem to be too affected by the fact that there are a dozen or so high-ranking individuals sitting in the conference room. First, he casually wipes his glasses with a piece of tissue. Then, he takes a lollipop from his pocket and puts it in his mouth. Finally, he pulls up the next presentation slide on the screen and continues speaking—or rather, mumbling. \"Mapping is something that is just about everywhere here in Gaea. Let me give you an easy example: all of us here, including myself, our bodies, every cell and every nerve in us, are all creations mapped to the Surface Layer from Gaea's database by means of computing power. I mean, if you really think about it, heh... can we really be said to be 'alive' in that case...?\"\n\n\"Anyway, I digress. My apologies. Threatening you is tantamount to threatening myself. Why would I allow myself to do such a stupid thing...?\"\n\n\"What I'm trying to say is, are we really the only ones who are mapped here? Besides humans and Modifiers, what else can we think of? Surely the same principle applies to everyone and everything?\" \n\n\"This is just like how Gaea immediately locks on to the Plane Layer as its target when it tries to counteract the hyperspace. It may look like a rather mechanical or even shortcut approach, but isn't this the most efficient way of getting things done? Like, instead of 'f(x)', we solve for 'x' itself?\" \n\n\"This is exactly why I say that I don't care whether the hyperspace experiment will succeed or not... There's already a better solution in front of us. There's no need to fight against any troublesome things, nor is it necessary for us to spend so many resources every year. And there is no reason for us to rely on the Modifiers...\"\n\n\"...Should I make it even clearer...? But if you're sitting here, you must have understood what I'm saying by now.\" \n\nThe conference room is as quiet as a windless sea. At least, it was until the man started biting down on his lollipop, again and again.\n\nThe man's jaws only stop moving when the red-haired woman taps the table twice with her index finger.\n\n\"Level V study, three years.\" \n\nAs if he's been subjected to some great humiliation, the man's eyes gradually turn red. His entire body has taken on a rigidity that wasn't here just moments ago. \"Y-you... can't be serious, Director Paracaesar! You're clearly biased against me!\" \n\n\"Biased?\" Paracaesar flips through the agenda in her hand and gestures to the secretary to bring in the next presenter. She then glances at the man in the white coat who's huffing at this point. \"Do you know what this place is, Mr. Whitman?\" \n\n\"...You shouldn't be the only one calling the shots at CORG. You know full well that this study should be a Level VII study, if not higher!\" \n\n\"The only thing I know is that you're still being an arrogant fool right now.\" Paracaesar, who is still leaning back into her chair nonchalantly, looks the man straight in the eyes and says calmly, \"The two things we're never short of here are geniuses, and those who think they're geniuses. While your line of thought is indeed intriguing and worthy of further exploration, CORG is unable to offer unconditional support for every idea that appears worthy in theory. If you leave now, you may still be able to catch up with the lady before you, to whom I've just offered Level VI funding. Talk to her and learn from her—assuming she's willing to expose you for your foolishness.\" \n\n\"Is this what you people do with truly inspired ideas? Trample on them?!\" \n\n\"It's always those with the least substance who crave recognition the most... Here's one last piece of advice for you. If you want respect, earn it with your achievements. If you want the chance to change the world, convince us with results. You must've heard of the data wall tech that was deployed in Molander ten years ago. That piece of tech came about from a mere Level II project. The least you can do is to get to that point before you come back to talk terms with me again.\" \n\nWhitman's time is up. The guards enter the conference room, and expel him without another word. Without another glance at Whitman, Paracaesar nods slightly at the young man waiting outside the door. \"Come on in.\" \n\n",

My poor heart was pounding so hard.\" \n\nThe three-man team, dressed so formally that they appear completely unapproachable to others, have just exited a surveillance network composed of countless cameras and sensors on the block behind them. They collapse as if they've just completed an extreme physical test. The most physically diminutive among the trio, a female, is leaning heavily on a railing, covered in cold sweat. She takes a canned drink from the burly man next to her, then takes a big gulp from it. It's only after this that she manages to speak.\n\nNordburg, completely empty, is still sealed off behind the computing power barrier. Nothing else is moving on the rundown streets, so there is no need to worry about being seen by passers-by.\n\n\"Well, fair enough. I mean, no one in their right mind would even dare to think of posing as OPRIC.\" The man produces another two sports drinks somehow, and hands one of them to his other colleague, a male who's skinnier and quieter than he is. Then, he knocks back his drink in a single mouthful. \"Seriously though, I wouldn't be surprised if we were put on trial in the future for what we're doing now in here.\" \n\nThe woman shudders at the phrase \"put on trial,\" and looks over at the quiet young man for reassurance. \"Roland...?\" \n\nRoland fishes out a pair of glasses from his pocket and puts them on. He then shakes his head resignedly and rolls his eyes at the burly one. \"Why do you talk to Bernini like this when you know how much of a scaredy-cat she is? And as an adjutant, shouldn't you have explained this to her already? I mean, Raphael... never mind.\" All Raphael has for Roland in response is a cheeky grin. Roland pinches his brow tiredly. \"To put it simply, the order given to us by President Red Fox will be filed as a secret document in the general archives as well as by OPRIC separately. So, relax. We'll be fine as long as we don't let the cat out of the bag here. Besides, just how many people you know in CORG have had the opportunity to 'borrow' OPRIC's authority?\" \n\n\"Oh please. It's not as if you can put this on your resume or even brag about it to other people.\" Raphael finishes the remaining half of his canned drink. He then takes a few deep breaths to calm down as he gazes at the building at the far end of the road. \"...Yeah, but you really have to experience this thing for yourself to know how outrageous it is—OPRIC's authority, I mean.\" \n\nBernini, who's recovered somewhat from both the exertion and the scare Raphael gave her, begins rebuking the latter with a punch. \"You! I can't believe you detained the head of the Intelligence Office and asked all those questions!\" \n\n\"Hey, hey, hey! That's called acting in accordance with your disguise! We'd have looked suspicious if we hadn't done that!\" \n\n\"How could you be so sure that OPRIC would ask so many questions?\" \n\n\"How can you be so sure that OPRIC wouldn't?\" \n\nThe two of them are trying to stare the other down with such intensity, they've even led Roland to ponder an issue (which may, or may not be important)...\n\n\"Please tell me... somebody here in our squad has actually seen OPRIC go about their duties before.\" Roland looks at his captain with an odd expression on his face, and after a brief silence, he asks, \"We're usually forbidden to talk about any missions involving OPRIC, and that's quite understandable in normal circumstances. But isn't that a little unreasonable right now?\" ",

Eyewitnesses reported seeing a beam of white light, source unknown, coming down from the night sky and hitting the convalescence wing of Saint Sophia Medical Center.\n\nIt is said that the white light appeared without any sound, lasted for a short time, and was extremely bright. The sound and vibration from the moment of impact were clearly apprehended by those within a one-kilometer range. Following the incident, on-site security personnel promptly initiated emergency evacuation protocols and moved all personnel from the building. A subsequent check showed that no one was hurt in the incident, though the whereabouts of the head of the medical center are unknown.\n\nThe police immediately cordoned off the scene after the incident and have convened a team of experts for an in-depth investigation of the incident. According to a spokesman for the city police, while the cause of the incident is not yet known, it may be related to the abnormal conditions that have appeared to the north. The police are now conducting a full investigation and will enhance airspace monitoring to prevent similar incidents from happening again.\n\nThe search for the head of the medical center is currently still ongoing. Citizens who believe they may have information about what happened or have discovered anything suspicious are encouraged to get in touch with the police.\n\nWe will continue to follow this matter and provide you with the latest updates as soon as we can.\n\n",

She's trying really hard not to show any sign of agitation.\n\nFortunately, the device reads out the code belonging to the watch normally, and the soldier at the camp checkpoint looks up at her with some surprise and admiration. \"Wow, you're a sergeant. You look really young.\" \n\n\"I was lucky... Yeah, I just was lucky, that's all.\" Ver's response is brief and perfunctory. By the time she hears the door opening, her heart is already in Molander. The figures she's known since childhood are flashing through her mind. But now that she's finally returned to Molander, should she go see everyone first, or hurry back to Aether Gazer...?\n\n\"Stop him!!! Don't let him get away!\" \n\nVer's Modifier body instinctively tenses up as a sudden premonition of Bane Energy hits her. She turns toward the source of the commotion to see a man in a CORG uniform rushing past her and toward the door. There's no time to assess the situation. Ver's body has already reacted by setting out to play catch up.\n\nThe person who's running away seems to be holding something. His movements can hardly be called swift, and he looks deeply desperate. Ver manages to catch up with him in no time, and blocks his way with her sword. The escapee tries to turn to the right to skirt around her, but for some reason, he loses his balance and falls heavily to the ground.\n\nIt is at this point that Ver realizes that the \"thing\" the soldier was holding is his own right arm, an arm that's now severely corrupted by Bane Energy.\n\n\"Stop running... Jerry,\" Ver reads the name tag on his uniform rather hesitantly. \"You're suffering from severe corruption. Go get yourself treated. Don't make your family and friends worry about you.\" \n\n\"Treated\"? The young man named Jerry looks down at his arm, his lips trembling as if he wants to say something. But now, the others have already caught up with him, and a look of panic, then hopelessness, appears on his face as he is surrounded.\n\nOne of them looks at Ver and asks uncertainly, \"Who are you...?\" This time around, she doesn't say anything, and simply shows them her watch. \"OPRIC...\" A murmur passes through the group. Even the young man on the ground is moved to look up at her.\n\n\"Amazing. You're so young, and already you move like such a pro.\" Jerry's voice is weak and wispy. \"I've never imagined that I would be lucky enough to meet an OPRIC elite...\" His face is pale, and sweat is rolling in beads down his forehead. He's also gasping for breath, looking like he might faint from the pain at any moment.\n\nVer quickly searches her pockets, remembering that she had some Bane Energy suppressant on her when she was in Xu Heng. But right now, her pockets are empty. All she can do is to squat down by Jerry and tell him, \"Maybe you'll be able to join OPRIC in the future. Just go back with them to get yourself treated first.\" \n\n\"In the future...\" Jerry's hand is still on his corrupted right arm, and on his face is an ugly expression somewhere between laughter and tears. \"The suppressant no longer works on me. I... I don't want to wait until I turn into a monster and they have to execute me...\"\n\nHe makes a sudden move with his left hand. Unknown to everyone, he had a gun hidden in his armpit. He points the pitch-black barrel of his gun at Verthandi, who's the person closest to him. The loud bang that ensues causes everyone on the scene to exclaim in dismay. However, the Modifier is faster. By the time Jerry raises his gun, he's been stabbed by the crimson blade.\n\nDespite the loud bang, there isn't a bullet hole to be seen anywhere on his body, only blood flowing from the heart where Ver's sword pierced it.\n\n\"No, no, how could I hurt a human...?\" Ver looks at her hand confusedly before a revelation hits her. \"Oh, that's right, the Bane Energy corrosion... From Gaea's perspective, he was no longer human.\" \n\nHis termination was reasonable by Gaea's logic.\n\nA mixture of blood and air is coming out from Jerry's agape mouth. He's struggling to keep his eyes open as the world before him continues to fade to black. \"Sorry, what did you say...?\" Before Ver can move any closer, Jerry's brief and final struggle is over, and he finally closes his eyes for the last time. Now, she's looking not at a person but a body that is still warm and at least still human-like.\n\nSomeone on the scene offered, \"He said thanks.\" \n\nHe thanked me? But I...\"\n\n\"In principle, CORG will provide treatment and lifesaving measures until the last moment. Though this is obviously out of good intentions, it also means that people who've been corrupted by Bane Energy can only wait in the ward until they turn into monsters and are then killed by their peers...\"\n\n\"He's far from the first one to attempt escape during treatment. After all, how many people can calmly accept their own death?\" \n\nThe soldier then bends down in silence. Ver puts away her sword and watches the soldiers pick up the body of their comrade and walk back with it to the camp. She can feel her heart beating really, really fast, so much so that even if she were to cover her heart with her hand it'd only beat harder in her chest.\n\nLub dub, lub dub, lub dub...\n\n",

But at the same time, you've definitely set foot on it. Ver stretches out her hand to cover the white in front of her with the flesh-colored back of her hand, then slowly moves away. As her eyes refocus, she's once again looking closely at the pure world of white in front of her.\n\n\"This is... just too real. Or should I say that it's too fake? The world of Gaea is really...\"\n\nThoth turns around, wanting to hear what the girl who is visiting the Plane Layer for the first time has to say, only to see Ver holding up her communicator with great enthusiasm, saying, \"This is really cool! I've got to take a few pictures to show Admin!\" \n\nThoth chuckles. Surely they can't be as excited as Ver is about this... But the girl next to her is indeed in high spirits. Like a child's toy, no matter where she's been thrown, she's always able to bounce right back.\n\nWhat does the world look like through the eyes of a toy? Thoth turns around. The Land of Moons here is gradually disappearing from view. The bookstore has undergone rounds of remodeling and the coming and going of various people.

I mean, what if you lose something again...\"\n\n\"Heh, you're right.\" Nishida sticks out her tongue cheekily. \"Even though I always get what I lose back eventually, I can't always count on my luck like this. Thanks for taking the trouble!\"\n\n\"What trouble? If it weren't for you, the three clinics on this block would still be at loggerheads... Hey, hey, watch your step!\" \n\nAs she walks slowly to the street, Nishida peels the candy in her hand from its wrapper, then holds the wrapper up to the sun in the sky. The rather crumpled piece of cellophane is shining with a multitude of colors thanks to the sunlight, with a kaleidoscope in each little crumple. It's a little like the streets, perhaps? Or falling leaves? Or different people...?\n\n\"Hey! Hey!\" \n\nNishida stops with a start, like a child who's done something wrong, and stands there awkwardly. Then, she places her palms together and bows in apology. \"I'm sorry!\" she says. \n\nThe girl in the wheelchair, with her arms crossed, says, \"But I haven't said a thing.\" \n\n\"I should have watched where I was going, instead of staring at the navigation app. I shouldn't have left—\" Nishida blinks a little, \"Hold on, I didn't leave anything behind this time, did I?\" \n\n\"Ha ha, you're so quick to apologize, Nishida.\" The girl reaches out her hand to Nishida, saying, \"Here. My mom made these scones. She said to give you some if I saw you.\" \n\n\"Your mom's scones! I'm not going to say no to them!\" Nishida takes the paper bag of goodies from the girl. The scones are still hot, and the bag is full of the aroma of baked wheat, butter, and jam. \"Wow, I love this so much. Now I have the feeling that no matter what I do today, everything will go smoothly!\" \n\n\"Maybe you should keep the navigation on in the meantime...\"\n\nThe girl, still a little unassured despite Nishida's chirpy pronouncement, waves at Nishida and watches her as she skips away. Then, when she looks down again, she suddenly notices something in her lap.\n\n\"Nishida!\" But Nishida is already gone. \"Never mind then...\"\n\nShe's looking at a small origami crane folded out of cellophane, bright and colorful in the light.\n\n\"I can't believe that an adult could be so forgetful... Guess I'll hold on to it for now and go see her when the cast is removed in a few days.\" \n\nWith a smile on her face that she herself didn't even know was there, the girl walks toward home in the sunshine, using her wheelchair as a walker.\n\n",

She can see people walking leisurely, stallholders calling out to passers-by, street performers, and a few middle school students laughing and walking while on their lunch break... It doesn't look like the incident in Nordburg has had much of an impact here. Everything in front of her is almost exactly the same as she remembers. She can't tell if this square is from the year 2305 (which she's never seen before), the year 2312 (when she was in middle school), or the year 2315, which she hasn't had the time to go back to see yet. \n\nShould she take a step forward or a step back?\n\n\"Mmm... I'm hungry...\" Her body begins to instinctively follow her memories, and a while later, a familiar-looking sign comes into view. \"Awesome! It's the fried chicken restaurant I always visited after school! I can't believe it's still—No, I should say, I can't believe that it's already here!\" \n\nVer stops right in front of the fried chicken restaurant. Its sign is still new and colorful, and its squeaky-clean glass door is devoid of any grease stains. Although reason is telling her that these differences make sense, her memories still resist all the incongruous details. She hesitates for a moment before she finally tries to push her way in.\n\n\"Huh? Why can't I... Nope, pulling doesn't do it either.\" \n\nThe situation now feels a little awkward for Ver, and she's about to pretend that she just made a wrong turn or something when someone behind the door suddenly appears. The lady boss looks younger than Ver remembers. \"Young lady, we don't open for business until next week.\" \n\n\"Heh... Sorry. I must have mixed up the dates.\" ...Does a difference of ten years really count as \"mixing up the dates?\"\n\n\"Are you really here for our fried chicken?\" \n\n\"Yeah. I'm a huge fan of your signature 10-Way Fried Chicken Platter!\" \n\n\"Our 10-Way... But that's not on our flyers...\"\n\nThe lady boss picks up the flyer next to her and takes a look at it, then lets out a laugh when Ver suddenly covers her mouth. \"Come on in. We're having lunch now, and we made way too much chicken for our practice run anyway.\" \n\n\"Really? Thank you so much!\" \n\nThis is the first time Ver is seeing the restaurant's kitchen with its dazzling array of kitchen utensils for herself. Before she can even orientate herself inside the store, the lady boss has already nudged her to a table. And now, she's bringing plates of food to her. One, two, three, four... Isn't this her favorite 10-Way Platter?\n\nShe can already smell the familiar aromas of the chicken from the table.\n\n",

Ver shakes her somewhat heavy head a little, and barely manages to rein in the Divine Grace that was starting to go out of control in her body.\n\nThese Cleansers sent by Gaea are very different from every other enemy Ver has encountered before, not only in their mode of attack but also in the energy they release. Specifically, it is the sort of enemy that seems to have a mild inhibitory effect on Divine Grace. This means that Ver has had to use a lot of strength to block even seemingly ordinary attacks. Besides, she's still a little weak. So despite using the \"energy-saving tips\" Thoth has taught her, Ver is still finding it difficult to continue.\n\n\"Is it over yet?\" \n\n\"There's another group coming.\" Thoth zooms in on the tactical map, and a new warning can be seen flashing in the block ahead. \"Take a break while you can. I'll take over if you can't do this anymore.\" \n\n\"No, it's okay... The more tired I am, the more I have to hang in there. That's how you make progress.\" Ver shakes her head as she tries to catch her breath while walking behind Thoth.\n\nIn contrast to Ver, who's panting heavily, Thoth looks to be in a much better condition. Or rather, she's been this calm and collected since the two of them met, as if she's managed to keep a certain distance from everything around her.\n\n\"Thoth, do you have any tips for dealing with Cleansers?\" \n\n\"Nope. I'm no more experienced in this area than you are.\" \n\n\"But why aren't you getting hit at all then? It's like you already know what they are going to do.\" \n\n\"Well...\"\n\nThoth raises her hand slightly, and the flying knives hovering beside her start to fly forward with their attached silk threads trailing behind. Then, as if they're surrounding an invisible core, the knives gradually speed up until the streams of light along their various trajectories come together in a ball of light.\n\n\"Maybe I'm just better at observing my opponents. You know, things like posture, habits of movement, changes in airflow and sound, the conversion of space and distance...\" The flying knives suddenly stop, and the ball of light splits into streams onto the moving threads again. Thoth summons the knives back to her and looks down at her hands. \"Since a frontal attack will put me at a disadvantage, I can only learn to read the situation. That's the only way I can have a fighting chance against an opponent who's more powerful than I am.\" \n\n\"Oh. So that's why you own a bookstore.\" \n\n\"Huh? Why are you bringing up the bookstore all of a sudden?\" \n\n\"Because you're so good at reading.\" \n\nThoth is first tickled by Ver's awful joke, but the more she thinks about it, the more the association seems to make sense. In the end, Thoth does not attempt to correct her distorted \"logic,\" and looks up at the light spots falling in the sky instead. \"If there's one tip I can share with you... it'd be: don't treat them like you would malfunctioning AGI Mechas or Visbanes. While the AGI Mechas' and Visbanes are coming at you, the Cleansers are coming at this world. To them, we're just unexpected obstacles. If all we do is watch, I don't even think we'd be attacked. Just like now...\"\n\n\"Have you noticed? That when they fall, they don't come for us at all.\" \n\n",

Friends, families, and couples have come together here, happy to be there as long as they're with each other.\n\nYeah, that's what it's like with Admin too.\n\nVer recalls the first time she and Admin had a barbecue while camping on the beach. By the time she was done moving the tent, Admin had already put the grill together.\n\nAdmin would always be exceedingly serious whenever the meat was on the grill. But the moment she took a bite and remarked on the barbecue's deliciousness, Admin would always respond with, \"I knew the heat was just right!\" \n\nAt night, they would sleep in separate sleeping bags but in the same tent, and they would always chat till late. Even when their sleeping bags were zipped up, they'd continue talking and even poke each other through the bags. But one time, they got a little too loud, and in the end found themselves apologizing profusely to the occupants of the tent next to them...\n\nBut more often than not, the outings Ver and Admin went on were more spur-on-the-moment than planned. For example, whenever Admin had been working for too long, or when Ver had been training for days on end, one would drag the other to the beach for a walk. It'd always start off as a \"short walk\" that'd conclude only many hours later.\n\n\"Hmm. Why do #{nickname}# and I always have so much to talk about?\" \n\nShe's uttered her thought out loud without realizing it, but there's no one around her, especially the person who'd always respond to her.\n\nShe sighs. \"I'd better get myself cured and finish whatever it is I have to do here quickly so that I can get back!\" \n\nBut there are still so many things she wants to do but hasn't gotten around to doing here. Besides, if this place is a perfect copy of the city of Molander in the year 2305, does that mean that...\n\n\"Hmm. I should go take another look at the medical center then?\" \n\nVer turns around and heads back into the city.\n\n",

Having politely rebuffed the owner's sales pitch, she cautiously looks in the direction of the two children who just went in.\n\nFound them! Her childhood self is sitting on a bench on the street, looking down and fiddling with her clothing. But where is the Admin of her youth?\n\nVer pokes her head around the corner a little more as she looks for the young version of the Prez, but her efforts come up empty. Did they go in a store to buy something? But that'd mean that they'd come back eventually, so she might as well wait here for a while. So, she ducks back behind the corner and starts to look at the shop owner's snack offerings in earnest.\n\n\"Hey.\" \n\n\"Agh!\" \n\nVer stumbles three steps back. Shocked, she looks at the person who's suddenly appeared behind her and snaps, \"What do you think you're doing? You scared me!\" \n\n...That sounded a little too familiar, didn't it...? #{nickname}#, with their arms crossed, snaps back: \"I should be the one asking you! What are you doing here?\" \n\n\"Would you believe me if I said I just happened to be here?\" Ver is close to tears. \"You're not going to interrogate me again, are you Prez?\" \n\nI would very much like to, but I won't be able to get even a single word out of you, will I? Despite feeling rather disgruntled deep down inside, #{nickname}# has managed to project a calmness that has in turn put Ver in her place. \"I'm the one asking the questions now. Tell me why you're here.\" \n\n\"Why...\" Ver thinks really, really hard for about three seconds, then gives up. \"I saw that you guys were out, and I was concerned for your safety, so I decided to follow you.\" \n\n\"That's it?\" \n\n\"Um... Or do you want me to make something up instead?\" \n\nThe look of coldness and indifference is still on the face of the person in front of her. How is it possible that a person so young can feel so forbidding...? Ver blinks and looks pitifully at the child who's much shorter than her, and finally sees them let out a sigh and unfold their arms.\n\n\"Do you want to come with us?\" \n\nVer is taken aback for a moment. \"Really? Can I?\" \n\n\"You've already followed us all this way anyway. Or do you want me to chase you away instead?\" \n\n\"Of course not.\" Ver scratches her head. \"But we don't have to walk together. I'm happy to trail you.\" \n\nPrez can't help but wonder about the girl in front of them. Sometimes she seems to have a very simple mind, while at other times it's almost impossible to guess at her intentions. \"So you won't hang out with us, but you'll follow us like some kind of cowardly mouse. Why is that?\" \n\n\"Because I don't want to get in your way!\" Ver's reply comes fast with zero thought. \"Ver, she rarely goes out, am I right? So this outing of yours is a big deal for her. I don't want to mess with that.\" \n\n#{nickname}# can see nothing but earnestness in Ver's eyes, and after a moment of silence, they reply, \"I'm off then.\" \n\n\"Huh?\" \n\n\"Can't make Ver wait too long, so I have to go back now. As for you... I can't possibly do anything to someone from OPRIC, can I? Do whatever it is you want to do.\" \n\nAnd off Prez goes toward the bench. Ver sticks her head around the corner again to see Prez call out to the girl, and a slight smile appears on the girl's face.\n\n\"How wonderful...\" Ver can't help but smile herself. As she looks away and turns her head, her eyes meet with those of the enthusiastic shop owner who's been hovering a short distance away the entire time.\n\n\"Um... I'll have this, this, and this. One of each, please. Thanks, boss!\" \n\n",

She's right: ten years down the road, there is a lane here in place of the store.\n\nVer is standing at this spot, feeling the sense of dislocation and disjointedness wash over her. She's spent years here in Molander, from her childhood and time of medical treatment to her schooling years, and she's been on this shopping street with her parents and friends on countless occasions. In her memory, there's always been a lane here, a long straight line, not a store, and certainly not a period at the end of a line.\n\nBut that means... This is a store she's never visited before!\n\nVer immediately perks up and breezes into the store.\n\nIt turns out to be a store offering \"flashing tattoo\" services. The \"instant tattoo\" is a small gadget that's temporarily left on the skin using special stickers and sprays. Unlike a conventional tattoo, the flashing tattoo can produce a small three-dimensional projection that glows, and some can change between various colors. While Ver doesn't quite get the fuss about this, she decides to pick out a design for herself anyway, since from the looks of the people around her it's something really popular in the year 2305. \n\n\"But Admin is in Sasanami now...\"\n\nVer decides to have a peace talisman printed on her arm. The pattern on the projection flickers with every movement of her wrist. Next to her is a girl who's had cherry blossoms printed all over her arm. Thinking Ver to be a like-minded enthusiast for the art form, she starts chattering at her, and it is quite some time before Ver is able to go on her way.\n\nVer leaves the store in a daze. However, it is not long before she runs into another obstacle. \"New on the shelves! Come try our hot new product!\" A sales robot with a product name emblazoned conspicuously on its body has held out a cup of strangely colored drink straight to Ver's mouth. What in the world is a \"Slow Smoked Celtuce and Melon Milk Drink,\" and why is it red? While Ver has never encountered this beverage before, she has had much experience in avoiding sales robots. All I have to do is to take half a step back, move sideways, and then dash forward quickly...\n\nBut the robot still manages to block her escape! Is it possible that the robot would've slowed down in ten years' time from wear and tear? Thankfully, no one is here to witness a Modifier's failure to dodge a sales robot...\n\n\"New on the shelves! Come try our hot new product!\" \n\nVer has no choice but to take the cup from the robot. To her surprise, the drink is actually good. So she buys one for herself, then continues to stroll along the street with her odd-colored drink and glowing talisman tattoo.\n\nVery soon, Ver has purchased a tiny windmill that can turn upside down, the hair accessory that's now on her head, and several bagfuls of various other items. But a quick scan of the street indicates that she's only visited less than half of the stores along the stretch!\n\nJust look at this shopping street of 2305...\n\nVer's hands are quite full at this point. She thinks for a moment, then turns around decisively and heads for the bookstore.\n\n\"Fine, we'll stop here today.\" \n\n",

Thoth has decided to conduct this special training upon their return to the bookstore after Ver's last contact with CORG's soldiers aroused suspicion.\n\nHmm, let me think...\" Ver ponders for a moment, and then a look of epiphany appears on her face. \"I get it now,\" she says, and she then begins her role play.\n\nVer snorts, \"I'm with OPRIC!\" Then, to further amp up the coldness and arrogance of demeanor called for by the role, she even waves her hand in a downward motion forcefully.\n\n\"Wow, Ver's really good at this!\" Nishida, who's sitting close by and watching, applauds Ver's wonderful performance.\n\nBut Thoth is not impressed at all. \"One more time,\" she says.\n\n\"Huh?

Get out of my way before I suffocate you with my presence!\" Nishida places her hands on her hips, with her chin high in the air, and even stares down at Thoth past the tip of her nose.\n\nNishida skips over to where Thoth is. \"How did I do, Thoth? I followed your instructions about how OPRIC should be like down to the very last word!\" \n\n\"...One more time.\" \n\nThoth would find her capacity for many things tested again and again by both Nishida and Ver in the hours that follow. It is only when Ver's stomach starts to rumble audibly that Thoth decides to end the training session.\n\n\"So, Captain Thoth, are we good enough now?\" Ver asks Thoth excitedly.\n\n\"...The next time you or Nishida encounter any CORG soldiers...\" \n\n\"Uh huh?\" \n\n\"Please, if you don't have to open your mouth, don't.\" \n\n",

Things really are exactly the same as they were ten years ago.\" \n\nVer is strolling along the shopping street, looking at the shops on both sides with nostalgia. She sees a beautiful dress in the shop window of a clothing store. This was a dress that she loved so very much as a child, and whenever she visited the shopping street, she would stop in front of the window and visualize herself wearing the dress someday. However, before Ver could don the dress for real, it disappeared from the shop window.\n\n\"Hello there miss. Would you like to try the dress?\" A lady comes out of the store and pulls Ver inside. And so, she finally realizes her dream from ten years ago. \"I really wish I could show Admin what I look like in a dress.\" \n\nVer is holding a box of freshly made takoyaki with bonito flakes sprinkled on top. She picks up one of the balls, and blows on it to cool it down before putting it into her mouth with a smile of satisfaction.\n\n\"Hi! We're 'The Sound of Youth,' a new student band! Next, we'll be playing our song, 'Winter Love'! Thank you for listening!\" Outside a record store, Ver sees that there's a street music performance, so she decides to join the crowd that has gathered for the girls' debut performance. The song titled \"Winter Love\" turns out to be really touching, like a love letter written to someone. However, Ver realizes that a girl next to her is shaking and close to tears.\n\n\"Are you alright?\" Ver takes out a paper napkin and hands it to the girl, but the latter shakes her head and dashes away from the crowd.\n\nThe band finishes performing the song, and it's clear that the band's debut has been a great success. As Ver leaves the record store, she hears someone yelling angrily, \"Why in the world would you play 'Winter Love'?!\" She hopes to herself that the girls will soon be able to resolve whatever disagreement they're having between them.\n\n\"BBQ special! All-you-can-eat premium wagyu, today only!\" Ver's mouth instantly begins to water when she hears this. Who would say no to the prospect of tender pieces of grilled beef, rich with unctuous fat, melting in one's mouth? And so, obviously, Ver walks right into the barbecue restaurant.\n\nAn hour later, Ver, having set a new personal record, walks out of the restaurant and continues down the shopping street to speed up her digestion. She walks into a gift shop, and studies its exquisite-looking items with a gleam in her eye.\n\nA shop assistant comes to her with a smile on their face. \"Hi, may I help you? Is there anything in particular you're looking for?\"\n\n\"My friend's birthday is coming up, and I'd like to get her a gift. She's been in the hospital, and I'd like to get her something that'd cheer her up and help her forget her illness for a bit.\" Ver can see Tarina looking out of the ward window in her mind's eye.\n\n\"You two must be really good friends.\" \n\n\"Yeah... I really hope she'll get better soon so we can go shopping and have barbecue together.\" There is a trace of loneliness visible in Ver's gaze.\n\n\"With friends like you by her side, I'm sure she'll get better soon!\" \n\nThe shop assistant's words cheer Ver up a little, and she starts to choose a gift from the shop. She's going to get something that will express everything she's felt for the intended recipient for the past ten years.\n\n",

Do you live around here or something?\" Yvette cocks her head to one side adorably.\n\nWhile Ver did indeed \"live around here,\" going by their actual ages Ver should be calling her \"big sister\" instead. Ver chuckles to herself quietly, then quickly comes up with an excuse: \"Oh no, I've got no idea who you are. I was just trying my luck with a random name. Who knew I'd get it right on the first try???\" \n\nFrom the look on the girl's face, it doesn't appear that Ver has been convincing. But Ver has already left her behind as she continues to walk forward. The small house in her field of vision is getting bigger and bigger. There it is, the familiar home built of white oak on the lawn.\n\n\"The flower bed at the door... Oh, that's right. It isn't here yet. I only built that with my dad after they adopted me.\" As Ver gazes at the house, her mind is flooded with the memories of various things that have happened out here on this lawn. She's standing blankly when the door of the house opens, and she instinctively goes, \"Mom...\"\n\nVer hurriedly covers her mouth to prevent herself from saying anything else inappropriate. But the young-looking woman has already noticed her, and is walking over to her with a gentle smile on her face. \"What are you standing out here for, young lady? Is there anything you need?\" \n\nAlthough Mom is wearing her home clothes today, her long hair has been carefully tied up. She looks neat and clean, and there's also a faint fragrance on her. The hair on her temples is much darker than when Ver communicated with her family not too long ago, though the fatigue and sadness are quite visible on her face. Mom and Dad would've endured Tarina's illness for many years by now. If only Tarina could get better...\n\nVer forces a smile and shakes her head. \"I'm fine. You have a beautiful front lawn, I must say.\" \n\n\"Thank you,\" her mom smiles back gently, \"my daughter likes flowers and plants very much.\" \n\nTarina does love them, as does Ver.\n\nVer chats with her a little longer, without saying anything more than she should, then turns and leaves just like any other passer-by. She walks down the hill, back through the little path, and finally stops at the corner where the coffee shop is.\n\nI'll be back again, Ver says to herself.\n\nSeeing that the coffee shop is running some kind of promotion, Ver pushes the door open and walks in. The rich aroma of coffee instantly fills her nostrils. The dust-covered memories have been awakened again, and the coffee shop in her memory becomes vivid and clear. Nothing here has changed, not the interior decor, nor the music coming from the vinyl record player.\n\n\"Hello, what can I do for you?\" A well-dressed older man asks Ver at the counter.\n\n\"I'd like pancakes and a caffè latte, please.\" In the past, whenever Ver came to the coffee shop with her dad, these were the two items she'd order. For a child, pancakes smothered in honey and butter undoubtedly bring joy and satisfaction, while the latte symbolizes a yearning for maturity and the eventual compromise and concession to bitterness.\n\nMost of the other customers at the coffee shop are also from the neighborhood, and their faces are more or less recognizable to Ver. There's Irene with her iced Americano in the corner writing in her notebook with her dreams of becoming a novelist; in another spot is Grandma Winnie, who's sitting by the sunny window as usual as she strokes the cat on her lap and sips on her black tea; then, there's Jane, who's dyed her hair red, sitting at the bar and chatting with the owner of the coffee shop while trying her best not to reveal her crush on him.\n\nVer has barely suppressed her urge to tell Jane when she'd eventually marry the boss when he brings pancakes and coffee to her table. The pancakes are as fluffy as ever, and the honey, equally sweet. Also unchanged is the taste of her latte. Even if progress and change can't be stopped, at least in this coffee shop Ver can still enjoy a spot of cozy familiarity.\n\n",

        "desc": "\n\n\"Whew...\" Ver dismounts from the training machine and draws a check mark on the cartoon board Nishida put up on the wall of the basement. \"I'm done with today's training.\" \n\nShe takes a quick shower and then walks upstairs from the basement with her belongings in her arms. Nothing seems to be out of the ordinary at the quiet bookstore, and there are no customers at this time. Lokken is probably lying on the couch playing her video games again...\n\nHold on, where is Lokken? Is she on the rooftop?\n\nVer puts down the things in her arms and decides to head up to see if she's really there. She's only taken a few steps in that direction when she notices someone who seems to have entered the store not too long ago. \"Tho—\" Ver stops herself midway, unsure of whom she's looking at. She looks a little to the left, and then to the right, and finally asks tentatively, \"Captain Thoth?\" \n\n\"You got the right one.\" \n\nSomeone else has told Ver that she had the right answer even before Thoth could open her mouth. Lokken is still holding her gaming device, and she's mashing a few random buttons with her fingers, but her mind is clearly not on it anymore. \"Looks like my mission isn't over yet, huh? What do you have for me now, Captain Thoth?\" \n\n\"I'm the owner of this bookstore, you know,\" Thoth responds rather good-naturedly. As she walks to her usual spot at the front counter of the bookstore, she's looking around, and she spots a throw rug on the couch, as well as a device charger and a heap of snacks on the table next to it. \"I take it that you've been making yourself at home here?\" \n\n\"Nah, no such thing.\" Lokken places her hand that is holding the gaming device behind her back.\n\n\"Really?\" Thoth looks over at her, and continues, \"Then don't touch the nuts in the cabinet next time. You aren't going to get them anywhere in the future anyway.\" \n\nLokken is stunned for a moment and she quickly looks across the room at the table, then at Ver. Now Thoth is also looking at Ver, and after a couple of ums and ahs, she decides to push the blame to the member of the trio who isn't present: \"It was Nishida! We were playing board games here yesterday and she said that the nuts were about to expire. Since we didn't know when you'd be back...\"\n\nVer smiles at Thoth sheepishly, only to see the latter retrieve a bag from under the front counter and throw it over to her. \"Oh, it's a bag of nuts... I didn't realize there were more hidden at the counter.\" \n\n\"This is my bookstore. Of course I'd know where everything's hidden.\" Thoth picks up another bag and walks over to Lokken. \"Do you want this?\" \n\nLokken's eyes wander for a moment before she replies, \"I not really used to wanting things.\" \n\n\"Well, I'm giving it to you anyway. Take it.\" Thoth shoves the bag of nuts into Lokken's hand, then goes back to the front counter where she sits down, pours herself a glass of water, opens up the book she's been reading, and finally breathes a sigh of relief. \n\nShe looks up from her book to see that Ver has gone to pick up the things she put down earlier, while Lokken is still holding the bag of nuts.\n\n\"I think I hear something from your gaming device,\" says Thoth as she turns the page of her book. \"Whatever it is you need to do, go do it.\" \n\n",

It's so nice to have barbecue right after a mission. It's true that a full stomach makes one happy.\" \n\n\"Norn, I've never met anyone who likes barbecue as much as you. We've had barbecue one, two, three... I've lost count of the number of times we've done this together.\" \n\n\"Heh. Of course I reward myself with barbecue after a mission! It gives me motivation for the next one! By the way, what do you like to eat, Nishida?\" \n\n\"Me? \"Me? I like sweet stuff like cakes and biscuits. I also bake cookies, but sometimes I mistake the salt for the sugar and end up with savory cookies.\" Nishida raises her index finger. \"But! I think savory cookies can be yummy too. And you can trust that cookies made by Nishida are always good.\" A thought suddenly pops into Ver's head as she places a few pieces of raw meat on the grill.\n\n\"Cookies... Do you think you can teach me to make cookies?\" \n\n\"Not a problem, Norn,\" says Nishida, \"Do you want cookies? I can make you a ton, and I promise to use sugar and not salt this time.\" \n\n\"No, no, there's someone very important to me,\" Ver stares at the grill as if she can actually see something from it. \"I'd like to give them cookies I made myself as a gift.\" \n\n\"Someone very important?\" Nishida rubs her chin and looks at Ver while making vague noises of agreement here and there. \"I get it. I totally do.\" \n\n\"What? What is it that you 'get'???\" Ver looks up at Nishida, a little puzzled. Nishida doesn't know Admin yet.\n\n\"It's okay, I won't make you say it. Don't worry, I have all kinds of cookie cutters, for example...\" Nishida leans closer to Ver and whispers a few words in her ear.\n\n\"What? No!!! That's not what I meant!!!\" Ver's hands fly to her cheeks, which have grown slightly hot to the touch. She picks up the tongs and continues, \"Hey, the meat is ready. We should eat it while it's still hot.\" \n\n",

Just as she's about to go and stop her, she feels a hand on her shoulder.\n\n\"...\"\n\nLokken turns around to see Thoth's eyes, deep as lake water, trained on her. She pouts and stops running after Ver. \"Are we really going to let her go by herself in her current state?\" \n\n\"She'll be alright. It's just training,\" Thoth replies. \"Why, are you worried about her?\" \n\nLokken doesn't respond to the second half of Thoth's response. \"You're the one in charge. If you tell me not to stop her, I won't.\" She then turns around and walks to the couch, causing Thoth's hand to slide down from her shoulder. Then, she lays down on the couch in one smooth motion, picks up the gaming console she threw aside earlier, and presses the start button.\n\nAs it plays its startup music, Lokken looks up. Thoth has come over to her and is leaning on the armrest of the couch on the other side. \"Tell me, how do you feel now?\" \n\n\"What can I possibly feel...? Captain Thoth, has anyone ever told you that you're as naggy as an old lady?\" Lokken starts swiping left and right on the gaming device screen, but Thoth is still looking at her from the other side of the couch. A couple of moments later, she looks up again to ask, \"So what's with the one in the basement today?\" \n\nThoth shakes her head but doesn't answer Lokken's question. Instead, she poses another one. \"What do you think of Ver?\" \n\n\"She's a silly and cheerful girl, what else?\" Lokken rocks the joystick on the gaming device distractedly. \"But now that she's not so chirpy anymore all of a sudden, it feels a little weird.\" \n\n\"Maybe she'll recover soon.\" Thoth looks in the direction of the basement, from which she can hear a couple of soft noises from Ver's training. \"Maybe you just have to get used to her again... But of course, we're out of time as it is.\" \n\n\"Ver... has learned something new about herself,\" Thoth says as she turns her gaze back to Lokken, who's already stopped looking at her gaming device, and is gazing at her instead with her scarlet eyes. \"Maybe this is one of those times in life where you meet with a life-changing challenge. If you can conquer it, there's a whole new world waiting for you. And if you don't... everything in the past and the future will change.\" \n\n\"Sounds like I'm not the one facing this 'life-changing challenge,' but that challenge myself.\" Lokken sits up slowly. \"She has to conquer this no matter what.\" \n\n\"Why do you say that?\" \n\n\"She has everything anyone can ask for. She's free and can do whatever she wants, she can show kindness to others and make friends with a snap of her fingers, she's excited about everything she does because she's doing what she wants to do... and not something someone else has foisted on her.\" \n\nLokken's arms are crossed, but her tone of voice is still relaxed and nonchalant.\n\nThoth hops off the couch, takes two steps toward Lokken, and smiles with a sigh. \"Lokken, you sound like a child who's looking at someone with candy in their hand.\" \n\n\"I...\" Lokken's mouth twitches a little, as if she's trying to flash her usual exaggerated smile, but in the end she simply gives up. \"I just envy her, that's all.\" \n\nThere is a decoration Nishida hung up for Ver dangling at the window next to the couch. Lokken reaches out and fiddles with it. The decoration glitters here and there as it moves in the light. \"I've been asking myself: why is it that she can have everything without having to prove herself, and I have to struggle so much but still end up with nothing?\n\n\"Actually, I don't really know why I wanted to take her Divine Grace from her that day. It just so happened that something snapped while I was struggling.\" \n\n\"But you had no real reason for that, right?\" \n\n\"...\"\n\n\"The two of us were never the same to begin with. I have nothing to hold on for,\" Lokken says, \"...but now, I feel that at least she's—\n\n\"Greenie's also outside, isn't she? And there's me. Oh, and the person who's very important to her.\" \n\n\"She has to conquer this no matter what.\" Lokken grits her teeth until she's almost lost all sensation in her jaws, and repeats forcefully, \"She has to have everything.\" \n\nThen, a warm touch on her forehead.\n\nLokken is taken aback for a moment, then raises her hand to swat Thoth's away. \"What do you think you're doing?!\" \n\n\"Nothing,\" Thoth replies with a smile. \"It's just that it suddenly came to me that you're actually more adorable than the one outside.\" \n\n\"Adorable? What nonsense.\" Lokken shakes her head, pulls out the gaming device from between the couch cushions, and presses the start button again.\n\nIn the game, the little man sets out for his adventure. They can still hear soft noises every now and then from the basement, alternating with the sounds of the little man's knife as he stabs and kills the monsters.\n\n",

The data barrier, unable to withstand the Realm Cleanser attack any longer, shatters into smithereens with a bang.\n\nFaced with the oncoming tide of enemies, the CORG soldiers tighten their grip on their weapons as they await Thoth's order to counterattack.\n\n\"...The enemy's here.\" The moment Lokken sees the Realm Cleansers, all the confusion and questions are immediately wiped from her mind.

The last remaining residents are hiding out in their homes in fear and looking out the windows at the soldiers on the streets, but they are unable to tell if the soldiers are wearing the same facial expressions beneath their masks\n\n...And what about me? What does my face look like now?\n\nThoth stops looking around her and pushes open the door to the interior of Land of Moons. So far, the bookstore hasn't been swallowed up by the great expanse of pure white. At first glance, it looks exactly the same as Thoth remembers it to be. But a closer look reveals items that were never in there before, such as a cup that's been used by Ver, the decorations Nishida has placed all over the store, and the gaming device Lokken left behind on the couch... Oh, and that giant pit in the basement.\n\n\"The walls might collapse over time, and if rain gets in here, the books will be ruined. Should I arrange for repairs or move to another location altogether...?\" Then, Thoth shakes her head, closes the door to the basement, and says to herself: \"Fortunately, I no longer have to worry about that now.\" \n\nAs she turns around, she notices several books on the floor. They must have fallen from the bookshelf due to the rumbles from the basement. Thoth picks them up one by one, stopping occasionally to read a book that's caught her interest. The novel with the green cover was among the first batch of products she brought in after taking over Land of Moons. She'd chosen it purely based on her preferences, and to this day, she still has remaining stock of the title. Nevertheless, she's still keen on reading it again the moment she opens it. The book with the white cover, on the other hand, was a new work by an author Ygritte liked, and has been quite popular with customers. Thoth wonders idly if the author has put out any new titles ten years down the road, though she suspects that if there are any she's already read them outside. And then there's the book with the red cover... which she hasn't finished reading because she hated the beginning. But now that she's skipped to the middle, she finds herself completely mesmerized by its plot.\n\nThoth has always been fully occupied by her work at CORG, and it feels like forever since she last had the time to read without any distractions. She's half-leaning on a bookshelf as she devours the books page after page. Now, she's on a mystery spanning from adolescence to old age. The protagonist has begun to doubt everything around him after the world he originally knew collapsed...\n\nThere's a violent tremor and the faint sound of people screaming outside, and more books fall to the floor. The pages in Thoth's hand tremble slightly, and she closes the book and returns it to the bookshelf. She looks at the books that've fallen everywhere because of the tremor, and decides against tidying them up again. Instead, she gingerly walks back to her usual spot at the front desk, taking care not to step on any of the books on the floor.\n\nThe flask is still hot to the touch. Thoth pours herself a cup of tea, opens up her notebook, and picks up her pen. The tremors outside continue, one after another. The tea leaves in her cup keep moving, as does the tip of her pen on the paper on the shaking table. Nevertheless, she tries her best to write down what she's feeling right now.\n\nThen, she lets out a deep sigh and ditches her pen, surprisingly with a smile. \"I wonder how Ygritte felt at that time... That version of 'me' outside will never, ever have an experience like this.\" \n\nThoth takes a sip of her tea and opens up her notebook again. This time, she lets the memories of the past carry her thoughts away. She doesn't even glance at the bookshelves, the potted plants, the decorations, the gaming device, and herself, all of which are turning pure white in an instant.\n\nAll this will soon be taken away. But the good thing is, the future is already here.\n\n",

        "desc": "\n\n\"Ms. Jessica Chambers?\" \n\n\"Yes, that's me. I'm here for the reappointment review.\" \n\n\"Actually, you've already passed the review. Here's your reappointment letter for the position of artist manager. But on behalf of the company, I must advise you that your performance score for the past year is somewhat worrying. Should you fail to improve on your score, we may suggest that you—\"\n\n\"I know, I understand completely! But performance scores don't represent everything, right? I don't want to become another one of those managers obsessed with money and superficial image. If I can't uncover a real pop idol, what use are a few numbers???\" \n\n\"But...\"\n\n\"I know, I know, I completely understand! Only better numbers can give performers access to more resources and better venues. Though I'd argue that while it's important for a pop idol to have these, they're not the most important things. Most importantly, they must be able to bring happiness to the audience!\" \n\n\"Um...\"\n\n\"Why would I even commit to a career switch at this age? Was it because I was fired by my last employer? No! It's because I really believe in the power of pop idols!\" \n\n\"Alright, Ms. Chambers, I'm sure you already made your representation in your review application. SGS has already kicked off signups for its second season. I'd urge you to make full use of this opportunity.\" \n\n\"...I understand.\" \n\nChambers walks out of the posh office building, and sits tiredly on a bench outside on the plaza. She's finally found the chance to look back on the woeful year she's just had on the work front. First, she was rejected by a trainee she had her eyes on, so she had no choice but to go scouting for fresh, albeit untrained, talents. Then, among the talents she picked out, one was later poached by a more successful agent, one left in a fit of pique, and the last one who honestly couldn't cut the mustard finally threw in the towel after struggling for six months, citing the need to focus on school...\n\nShe still vividly remembers the day when the last young lady asked to bow out. She'd finally secured a performance opportunity for her and excitedly ran to tell her, only to find that the lights in the practice room were turned off. The girl, standing in the shadows, listened to her with tears in her eyes, and finally told her with a deep bow, \"Jessica, I know you've been working really hard, and I really want to thank you for that, but... I don't want to be an idol singer anymore.\" \n\n\"I don't want to be an idol singer anymore.\"\n\nWhat made the young lady want to be a pop idol in the first place? For that matter, what made her want to be an agent?\n\nChambers slightly loosens her aching heels from the back of her pumps, and looks up at the giant screen above the square, which is now showing a publicity reel for the SGS competition. The top idol groups of the previous session appear on the screen one after another. The girls are singing, dancing, and cheering. The bright light of the stage is shining down on them, and their young and energetic faces are looking very much god-like at this moment... A number of young fans have gathered under the screen, watching the reel and discussing their favorite idols with great excitement, even waving their hands to support the images moving on the screen.\n\nDid she become an agent just for what she's looking at right now? Or is there more to it?\n\nSome vague images are flashing through her mind, but as usual, she can never manage to see them clearly. Chambers looks away and pulls out a few printouts of a shelved plan from her files. Before she was fired, she'd worked late into the night on countless occasions to refine the proposal, then later saw the scenes she imagined in her dreams.\n\nThis time... This time around for SGS, she must find the most perfect idol singer and make her imagination become reality on the stage!\n\nChambers gets on her feet, then sits back down with a groan almost immediately and looks at his broken pump with some distress. There's also her slightly uncomfortable ankle, which she injured years ago as a child.\n\nFine. If I'm going to look for the perfect idol singer, I have to start by first changing into a pair of flats suitable for walking.\n\nJust as she is feeling ready to head to the shoe store, she spots a figure with long brown hair walking by in the corner of her eye. What did she just see...???\n\nChambers turns back, but she can no longer find the girl she's just seen in the crowd.\n\n",

        "desc": "\n\nFound her!\n\nChambers is holding a newspaper in one hand and pretending to read it while taking surreptitious glances at the girl with long brown hair. The girl is talking to the owner of a shop, and her youthful face has been made even livelier and lovelier by her cheerful smile. Chambers is so very tempted to tear up the newspaper in her hand. Why is such an adorable girl like this just walking on the streets like that??? Why hasn't her agent taken her to the highest and brightest stage yet???\n\nFor some reason, she can feel her heart speed up dramatically. Her intuition is telling her that once she catches hold of this girl she'll be able to realize the scenes she's seen in her dreams.\n\nThe girl continues on her way after her conversation with the shop owner, and Chambers hurriedly folds the newspaper neatly so that she can follow and observe the girl again. When she looks up, however, her breath stops for a moment: the girl with the long brown hair has just waved to someone, and is now walking toward another girl with short, light green hair. The two start talking about something with smiles on their faces.\n\nAn absolutely perfect pair of girls with pop idol potential! Two!!! Is she actually dreaming???\n\nChambers pinches the flesh of her palm hard. Then, she starts looking in her purse for her business card so that she can go up to them, stat. But before she can do that... she sees the two girls walking toward her.\n\nThe duo looks even more perfect when seen from the front. How charming they would look in the spotlight once we dress them up! They look like they can dance, and their voices sound really nice too... Hold on, what are they saying...?\n\n\"Excuse me, ma'am, are you looking at us?\" \n\n\"Yes, yes!\" \n\n\"Huh?\" Verthandi and Nishida exchanged confused glances, not understanding why this strange lady in front of them would so readily admit to spying on, and following, them. But she doesn't have any weapons on her, nor is she giving off a Bane Energy signature, so she doesn't seem to be a threat to them. Ver hesitates for a moment, but doesn't reach for her Access Key. Then, in her best imitation of Shu and Thoth, she goes, \"I must warn you, in case you have your eyes on us...\"\n\n\"Yes, I do have my eyes on you!!!\" Ver and Nishida immediately take a half step back, but the strange lady lunges at them with... two business cards from her purse, saying, \"Please, I think you two should become pop idols!\" \n\n\"Huh???\" \n\nNishida takes a business card from her, and Ver reads the words on it with some puzzlement: \"Jessica Chambers, agent, recruiter for SGS Season 2...\"\n\n\"SGS... That's 'Shining Girl Star,' the biggest girl idol competition in Ain Soph! Many girls have already realized their dreams thanks to Season 1 last year!\" Chambers, with her hands raised in excitement, continues in a louder tone of voice, \"I knew you two were born to be idols the moment I saw you! If the two of you take part in SGS, I'm positive that you'll do well and become the most dazzling stars on the SGS stage!\" \n\n\"Um... we can't sing or dance, and we've never received any training in that area,\" says Ver as she scratches her head. \"Ms. Chambers, there must be somebody more suitable out there.\" \n\nSeeing that Ver is starting to leave, Chambers quickly takes a step to the side to stop them, and produces two flyers from a folder. \"Please, think about it. You're some of the most suitable candidates I've ever seen. I can see the power in both of you.\" \n\n\"The power in both of us...?\" This throws Ver for a loop again. Can she actually see Divine Grace...?\n\n\"The power to bring happiness to people,\" Chambers' face is now very serious. \"The two of you have such beautiful smiles. If you go on stage like this, you'll definitely be able to move the audience and bring much happiness to them.\" \n\n\"But...\" But Modifiers do dangerous and secret work. Can they really be idols?\n\n\"I like this idea.\" \n\nVer and Chambers turn around at the same time, and see Nishida, who's been looking at the flyer with great interest, look up at them. \"I mean, if you think about it, you're working hard to bring happiness to mankind, just like us. If I can bring a smile to everyone's faces... just the thought of it is making me so happy.\" \n\n\"See??? You get it!!!\" Chambers takes a step forward excitedly. \"Humanity has evolved to the point where we no longer have to worry about our basic needs, and technological advancement has also allowed everyone to live more comfortable lives. Beyond our basic desires and day-to-day lives, we humans will eventually want to pursue a more beautiful, dazzling existence. Idols are the very embodiment of all things beautiful and wonderful, and of happiness itself!\" \n\n\"Looks like you're really into pop idols,\" Nishida turns to Ver. \"So how about it, Norn? Do you want to think about it?\" \n\nVer looks at the flyer in her hand. The girls in the photo are glistening with sweat from top to toe on stage. \"But I've really never learned to sing or dance, and if I go on stage, there'll be so many people watching... Um... I don't know if I can perform to everyone's liking...\"\n\n\"Everyone will love you! Please, don't say no to me now.\" Chambers takes out her communicator and looks at Ver with great sincerity. \"If you don't mind, just leave your contact number with me. You can get in touch with me again once you've decided.\" \n\n\"I'm up for it. How about you, Norn? Wanna do this together? \n\n\"Mmm, I... I'll give you my number then.\" \n\n\"Sure, sure. Call me whenever!\" \n\nThe two girls leave as they have other errands to complete, leaving Chambers behind at the plaza. She looks through the contact information they just left. \"'Nishida'... 'Norn'... these names...\" She stops for a moment, for something seems to be flashing through her mind, but as usual she can't quite get a clearer picture of it. \"They sound quite good, actually. Maybe we may not need to make up stage names for them after all. Hmm... With the two of them, maybe I can finally put that plan in motion...\"\n\nThe more Chambers thinks about it, the more she can see the two girls play out the scenes she's dreamed of so many times in her mind's eye, and she becomes increasingly excited. She pops into a nearby coffee shop, orders a cup of coffee, and pulls up the plan on her terminal.\n\nThis time... I'm sure I can...\n\n",

        "desc": "\n\n\"Look over there.\" \n\nNishida is pointing to something. Ver and Thoth turn their heads to see a roadside billboard playing an ad for a new beverage product. The spokespersons for the brand are in various cute poses in front of the camera and smiling brightly while holding fresh fruits in their hands.\n\n\"This girl group, 'NeW1nd', came in second in the first season of SGS,\" Nishida says as she puts her hands together. \"I really like the one with short hair.\" \n\n\"Huh?\" Ver looks at the billboard in surprise, then looks over at Nishida. \"So you've heard of SGS before?\" \n\n\"Actually, the company that runs SGS, SENS8TE Entertainment, is owned by Aether Gazer... But the reason I know about SGS is that it's been such a hit. You can see the pop idols from the show all over the place. It's really odd that you've never heard of it, Norn.\" Nishida is pointing here and there, all over the square, at a juice ad, at restaurants recommended by certain idols, and at giant posters blaring the dates of upcoming tours... \"Besides, it's really fun to watch these idols perform from time to time.\" \n\nThoth is looking at the blank expression on Ver's face with great interest. \"Why are you talking about this all of a sudden?\" \n\n\"Because we were propositioned today!\" Nishida hands Thoth the business card she received earlier. \"She says that we're natural-born idols and that we'll definitely do well in the competition if we take part.\" \n\nThoth takes the name card and examines both its front and back. \"Doesn't look like a scam to me.\" \n\n\"But isn't it a little odd for a Modifier to become an idol?\" Ver looks at the business card in Thoth's hand, and continues, \"After all, our battles are kept from the public, and we even have to keep our identities secret when we're off duty. So how can we become public figures? Surely you agree with me, Thoth...\"\n\n\"Actually, I think it's okay for the two of you to take part.\" \n\n\"Huh?\" \n\nThoth hands the business card back to Nishida. \"Modifiers are also members of Gaea. There's no need to make fighting Visbanes all there is to your life. An appropriate level of activity in public is good for both your physical and mental health, and I don't remember anything in Aether Gazer's or CORG's rules that should stop you either.\" \n\n\"Is that so...?\"\n\nLooking at the duo, one confused and the other pleased, Thoth nods. While she doesn't really watch idol performances, there's nothing wrong with letting them go and have some fun. Besides, this is just the hyperspace. She raises her hand and points to the billboard. \"I'll see you up there next time.\" \n\n\"I don't think we'll have the time, I mean—\"\n\n\"It's precisely because we don't have the time to dawdle that we've to do the things we've never done before now!\" Nishida takes Ver by the hand and tells her, \"I don't want to go on stage by myself, Norn. So would you come with me?\" \n\nLooking at the excitement and sparkle in Nishida's eyes, Ver feels her heart speed up. \"I...\"\n\n\"Hey, that store over there, are they selling SGS merch?\" \n\nThoth's query draws the attention of the two girls. Nishida pulls Ver over to the store, and they see a vast assortment of posters, albums, fan merch, and concert paraphernalia on the shelves. The store is packed, with potential customers almost spilling out the front of the store. Nishida, who seems to have navigated scenes like this before, immediately weaves all the way inside. \"Hey! There are even limited-edition posters of NeW1nd over here!\" \n\nVer chooses to stand by a shelf, where she observes the people around her with some caution and curiosity. The excited discussions, the sounds of laughter... Is this happiness she's seeing really brought to them by their idols?\n\nShe looks further inside. A large poster advertising the auditions for SGS's Season 2 has been put up on a wall inside, and a girl who looks like a student is looking at it intently. Is she imagining herself on that floodlit stage on the poster, perhaps?\n\nVer walks over to the girl and asks, \"Are you taking part in the auditions this season?\"\n\n The girl, seemingly startled by Ver's sudden approach, goes red in the cheeks and stammers, \"I... um... I... can't...\"\n\nThe girl shakes her head and backs away frantically, then disappears from Ver's sight.\n\n\"Why is she so afraid...?\"\n\n\"TADA!\" A poster suddenly appears in Ver's view. On the poster is an adorable girl with short hair holding a microphone. It feels as if she's looking right through the paper and at Ver. Then, the poster is moved away, and replaced by Nishida's face. She looks thrilled. \"I got it! I got it! It's a signed poster, too... Hey, what are you looking at?\" \n\n\"Nothing.\" Ver looks away from the direction the girl ran off in. \"I'm thinking I should buy some fan merch too. Any ideas on what I should get?\" \n\n\"Ooh, there's plenty to choose from.\" Nishida puts away her prize and drags Ver back to the shelf in a single movement. \"Here's the complete collection of the contestants from the last season. Oh, and this, this is a badge with the SGS logo, which symbolizes the core values girl idols should have...\"\n\n",

Whoever put this up definitely did it with care. On the poster is a group of lovely-looking girls and the group's name written in beautiful cursive script.\n\n\"'Flourish'...\" Ver reads the name on the poster out loud, and then sees the logo next to the name. So that's why they look so familiar. The last time she saw these girls was just the day before, when Nishida dragged her to look at a picture book. \"Aren't they the champions of SGS Season 1?\" \n\n\"Do you know them too, Norn?\" Tarina looks up at the poster. \"I've watched their show together with Ver before.\" \n\n\"With whom? ...Um, Ver?\" \n\n\"That's right. One day Ver heard this music coming from outside and stood by the door for a really long time, so I went to Dr. Gloria and asked her to let us watch the program. Have you watched it before, Norn?\" \n\n\"I...\"\n\nTarina is still staring at her, full of curiosity, and Ver feels a sudden flush of annoyance at the unreliableness of childhood memories. But... Tarina's words seem to have jogged something. When she was still in the hospital, there was a short period of time when there would be these girls wearing beautiful stage costumes and singing and dancing happily on the TV. Was she the first to ask to watch the show, or was it Tarina? Ver can't remember now. The beautiful and healthy girls on the telly would sometimes remind her of her own sick, feeble body. But even when she got uncomfortable after standing too long on her feet, Tarina would hold her by the hand and sway gently to the music.\n\n\"I've seen a few episodes. Do you like these programs?\" \n\n\"Mm-hmm! Ver is always in such a good mood after watching the show. They really bring a smile to our faces.\" \n\nYes... just like you.\n\nVer looks at Tarina. The girl in front of her is still smiling slightly as she recalls the sensation of watching the program, just like how a lamp that's fallen into the water is still glowing.\n\nIt's settled, then. Ver would let Nishida and Ms. Chambers know that she's signing up for the SGS auditions.\n\nShe's going to try and shine on that stage and bring smiles to everyone, like the others once did for her.\n\nBut would I make a good idol singer?\n\n",

The person having a nightmare struggles restlessly in her arms, then suddenly opens her eyes.\n\nAs she rubs her aching temples, she slowly gets up from her slumped position on the coffee shop table to reach for her drink. But the container isn't ice-cold to the touch as she expected. Chambers is dumbfounded for a moment, before she realizes that she's almost through with the iced coffee she ordered, and what she's holding now is a cup of warm water.\n\nBut she doesn't remember having asked for water... Did a server come by her table by any chance?\n\nChambers looks around a little, but nothing in her field of vision answers her question, and so she orders another coffee. Projected from her terminal is the plan she was working on all night long. Though she has had to make amendments to it based on the rules of SGS Season 2 which were just announced, she's been kept busy in the day preparing reference materials for the company's other artists as she, in the words of the company, \"does not have any artists under her wing anyway.\" As a result, Chambers can only work on her plan in her free time, far away from the office.\n\nThis is also a good time for her to look at the list of hopefuls who've already signed up for the Molander auditions. While Nordburg is going through a rough patch, things are still normal in Sudburg, so there are quite a few ladies from there on the list. Though those who have signed up are all beautiful and endearing, Chambers is confident that none of them can compare to Norn and Nishida. That is, if Norn and Nishida actually make it to the competition...\n\n\"What happened to the two of them...? Why haven't I heard from them? Didn't they agree to this already???\" \n\nBut Chambers is no stranger to the situation where a girl who'd earlier agreed to be managed by her would suddenly do a U-turn one way or another. In fact, she's even been ghosted before. But when she recalls the smiles on Norn's and Nishida's faces, she knows that she can't possibly find better candidates. So, she decides to make a last-ditch attempt before the signup deadline passes.\n\nHowever, the SGS competition is for girl groups of three members each. Although girls who sign up individually may also form their own groups after being accepted for the show, Chambers prefers to have a group that's been together from the very beginning. As a result, over the last few days she's also been looking for someone who can be the third member of the group.\n\nIt's almost time for her appointment.\n\nHer coffee is brought to her table, and the numbers on her terminal clock keep on changing, but the seat opposite her remains empty. Chambers opens up the third chat to find it also empty, and lets out a sigh. It's time to admit that it's all over.\n\nJust what exactly went wrong, and when? Was it that from the beginning, the fact that she switched careers to become an agent...?\n\n(Beeping sounds)\n\nChambers jerks her head up to look at the projection from her terminal again.\n\n\n\n\"We're sorry! We're really sorry!!!\" \n\nVer and Nishida clasp their hands together apologetically in unison. They tell Chambers, \"We didn't mean to ignore you. Something happened a while ago and we weren't able to look at our messages.\" \n\n...Finally. I was about to pack up and leave town, you know.\n\nBut Chambers doesn't say this out loud to the girls. Or rather, she's forgotten it in an instant. The moment the two girls reappeared in front of her, Chambers's heart, which has burned up and reduced to a pile of dead ashes repeatedly over the past three days of waiting, is now throbbing and burning again for her future pop idols.\n\nI must create the best possible conditions for them so that everyone can see what I see... real idols!\n\n\"That's all right. But since you've decided to take part, you have to start practicing. We don't have much time.\n\n\"Have you looked at the plan I sent you?\" \n\nThe two girls shake their heads at her with the same bewildered faces. But Chambers, ever the steady and reliable agent, isn't fazed. \"No problem, I can walk you through it now. To be an idol is to live your life in the spotlight.\"\n\n\"To be an idol is to live your life in the spotlight.\"\n\n\"Apart from knowing how to sing and dance, the most important thing for an idol is to showcase herself confidently in front of the camera so that the audience can be fully charmed by her and become happy as a result.",

They're quietly following the rhythm in the demo video while making small gestures with their fingers... and then their fingers bump into each other.\n\n\"Hold on, was it this move just now?\" \n\nVer fast forwards the video a little: \"No, we should be turning to the left first, then extend the left arm.\" \n\n\"Heh, my mistake. But I think if I make just a half turn here and then jump over here, then add a big step here, it'll all go better with the music.\" \n\n\"Do you mean like this?\" Ver looks at Nishida's gestures and tries to repeat them step by step in her mind. \"Does feel that way, yeah. Let's write it down and ask Daisy later.\" \n\nDaisy is the dance teacher that Ms. Chambers hired for Ver and Nishida and whom the duo had just met the day before. Although they only met in the evening, Daisy still took them through the music and moves, and since they're both Modifiers, their physical fitness and motor skills allowed them to pick up almost all the moves in a single run. Daisy was very pleased with what she saw, and even said that it'd be so great if every hardworking student were as talented as them. Ms. Chambers, who was standing by the side the whole time, almost burst into tears at the sight.\n\nFast forward to this morning. The two of them found themselves with a little bit of free time, but they didn't go to the practice room Chambers had arranged for them. Instead, they've chosen to stay in the bookstore because...\n\nThe door opens, and Thoth walks in. Ver and Nishida put down their earphones and jump to their feet at the same time. Thoth studies the excited and slightly nervous faces of the two girls, and asks, \"What's going on?\" \n\nNishida's eyes are shining with anticipation, while Ver scrambles to organize her intentions into words. \"Um... Thoth, I've noticed that there's always some music being played here at Land of Moons. Do you like listening to music?\" \n\n\"I guess so. I also go to concerts and band performances when I have the time. Why do you ask?\" \n\n\"N-Nothing. I just feel that music and dance are both such beautiful arts that can help cultivate our temperament. And if we put them together...\"\n\nThoth raises her eyebrows slightly. \"Have you encountered some kind of problem in your idol career?\" \n\n\"Heh, you're sharp.\" Ver rubs her hands awkwardly. \"Actually, we're still short of a group mate. Since you're so fond of music, Thoth, would you like to join us for the competition?\" \n\nNishida adds helpfully, \"There's no need to make your work at CORG all there is to your life.\" \n\n\"That's right, an appropriate level of activity in public is good for both your physical and mental health!\" \n\n\"Are you using my own words against me now? Hmm... Let me think about this.\" \n\nThe two girls continue to stare at her like two wide-eyed puppies. Thoth sits down at a table and reaches for some water.\n\nBecoming an idol, huh...? That's also a free choice of sorts.\n\n\"Alright, I've decided. I'll do it. I mean, we're in the hyp—\" Thoth stops herself before Ver and Nishida can start to make eye contact with her. \"Do we have a guest?\" \n\n\"Actually, our agent, Ms. Chambers, is here too.\" \n\n\"Does Ms. Chambers... want me to sign a contract?\" \n\nThe bedroom door swings wide open, and out of the bedroom storms out a person who then somehow manages to make a graceful stop in front of Thoth. \"Hi. My name is Jessica Chambers. \n\n\"Hello,\" Thoth's hand is on her chin. Though the lady in front of her looks like she's been working for many years, her facial expression is still as simple and relentless as that of a child. \"As you've heard, I'm willing to take part in the SGS auditions. Is there anything you want to share with me?\" \n\nChambers has a business card tightly held in one hand. \"I have no doubts about your personal charms, Miss Thoth. But I must emphasize that while being an idol is a happy thing, it's not something to be taken lightly. I sincerely hope that every girl who chooses to become an idol does so because she really, really wants to.\" \n\n\"Why, do I look like I won't take being an idol seriously?\" Thoth smiles. \"No. Choosing to go on a shining path and dancing on the stage to bring smiles to others... I want to do that, too.\n\n\"Hmm... Alright. Let's give it a shot, then.\" \n\nWith a few taps on Thoth's terminal, the lights in the bookstore change, and a new song starts playing. That polite yet distant smile of hers has disappeared in an instant. Thoth's face is now illuminated by the snow-white light, and she is looking straight ahead with a serious and focused look on her face.\n\n\"I've never heard if the entangled bird feathers/Were born after the fall, or whether/They've always existed...\"\n\n...\n\nThoth stops after singing a few lines, but the shock the other three seem to be in lasts much longer.\n\n\"Wow...\" Nishida grabs Ver by her shirt and shakes her back and forth excitedly. \"It really looks like Miss Thoth is performing on stage!\" \n\n\"I've never seen her like this either... Um, Ms. Chambers!!!\" \n\nVer reaches out to grab Chambers, who's breathing rapidly and about to pass out, and helps her to a chair.\n\n\"I'm fine, it's just an old ailment. Just give me a little time to recove— Miss Thoth, please! You must take part in the SGS auditions, no matter what!\" \n\n",

Lighting is very important to our theme this time, yeah, and I haven't seen any issues either...\"\n\nThe auditions are slated to kick off in half an hour. The stage has been set up in a plaza in Molander, and folks are scrambling to get the final pieces into place. After several checks to make sure that everything is indeed alright, Chambers finally turns back to the prep room.\n\nThe room, which is inside the building behind the stage, is full of girls. Some of them are chatting excitedly with each other, while others are warming up their voices or stretching their limbs. Chambers stands at the door and looks around at everyone in the huge room. For a moment, she seems to be seeing in the room all those teenage girls who'd left her, and who couldn't possibly be in here. She shakes her head to free herself from the image, and walks right inside to the innermost part of the room, when she finally spots the three girls who've come with her.\n\nThoth is looking at her stage costume with an odd facial expression, as if she has some unspoken complaints about the shiny embellishments. Nishida is flitting around the other girl groups like a butterfly, marveling over their beautiful dresses and makeup looks. Ver, on the other hand, is seated in her spot, singing her lyrics over and over again in front of the terminal to make sure that she's memorized them.\n\n\"Norn.\" \n\n\"Huh? Yeah?\" \n\n\"Feeling nervous?\" \n\nChambers kneels down on one knee in front of Ver and looks her straight in the eye.\n\n\"Yeah... I mean, this is my first time on stage as an idol, and I'm just afraid that I'll forget the lyrics,\" Ver chuckles shyly while slowly adjusting her breathing. As Chambers continues to look at her, she suddenly realizes something: \"Ms. Chambers, are you feeling nervous too?\" \n\n\"I...\" Chambers isn't sure what to say.\n\nHer long-awaited dream of seeing her most perfect girl idols on stage is now right in front of her. The talent they've shown over the past few days of practice is enough to turn most idols in the business green with envy. Furthermore, they've already improved by such leaps and bounds within such a short time. Much painstaking work, and repeated checks, have gone into the music, lyrics, and stage design. They may be at the auditions, but Chambers knows that they have something that's even good enough for the SGS finals.\n\nBut... It feels like something is still missing.\n\nIt feels like they're still missing the excitement she felt when she first saw Norn in the crowd, the inexplicable intuition she had when chasing Norn and Nishida... While she knew that she had what she'd always dreamed of when she saw the girls, now she isn't sure what that vague thing is, and whether it'd show in the performance.\n\nA pair of hands suddenly land on the duo's shoulders.\n\n\"It's too late to back out now,\" says Nishida in a tone far more earnest than her usual, \"The stage is for all idols. All we have to do is step up to the plate.\" \n\nThoth has also joined the group. \"Come on, this is nothing to get worried about. You aren't the only one on the stage, too. We'll be there with you. Besides, didn't Daisy also give us tips on how to deal with anything that might crop up?\" \n\n\"Heh... You're right.\" \n\nAs the three girls cheer each other on, Chambers stands up without a word and takes a half step back to make room for them.\n\nForget about it... Maybe whatever it is will appear on stage naturally once the girls are up there...\n\n\n\nPrep time is soon over.\n\nLots have been drawn, and the girls are the third on the list to perform. Then, finally, after some scurrying around and some last-minute instruction-giving backstage, Chambers escorts them to a spot just below the stage, then finds herself a seat in the audience. There, she stares at the equipment on the stage nervously, fearing that something might go wrong. Everything will be alright this time... Everything will be perfect and non-disappointing...\n\nAll of a sudden, Chambers takes a sharp breath, and stares in disbelief at a girl not far away who's wearing a volunteer's shirt.\n\nThe girl has just finished distributing items to the audience. Although the people around her are still chatting with each other, she's already looking up at the still-dark stage.\n\nLuna... What is she...?\n\n\"Jessica, I know you've been working really hard.\" \n\nDid she give up already? Because she couldn't take it anymore?\n\n\"I don't want to be an idol singer anymore.\" \n\nDidn't she say that it hurt her to even think about the stage?\n\n\"Ladies and gentlemen, next up, we have...\"\n\nThe emcee's voice is booming over the speakers, and Chambers forces herself to turn her eyes back to the stage.\n\n\"...a group that's had only one week of practice before today. Nevertheless, they are confident that they'll bring you a phenomenal performance!\"",

Luna, who's been invited to dine with them, does the same. As Chambers excitedly reads out the next step of her plan, Ver walks over to Thoth and asks quietly, \"So, how are their memories going to be rewritten?\" \n\n\"CORG doesn't rewrite memories. We wipe them. However, we'll also use official reports in the media to guide those whose memories have been wiped so that they can use their imaginations to fill in the missing memories,\" Thoth explains. \"Since we didn't encounter any Visbanes this time, we should only be erasing the memories of our actions. Most likely, they'll 'remember' that we had an accident on the stage, were saved, and then got to perform again.\" \n\n\"Would the two of you pay attention, please!\" \n\nChambers knocks on the table. \"The main competition will start in a month's time, at Core City. Although your performance has been excellent, ladies, we'll still have to prepare for it as best as we can.\" \n\nVer is dumbfounded. \"Core City? In a month?\" The question of whether she can stay here for a month aside... There's also the fact that Core City doesn't actually exist in the hyperspace.\n\n\"That's right. Didn't you know about this already? While SGS is holding its auditions in various cities across Ain Soph, the competition proper takes place in Core City. But don't worry, the organizers will provide all participating groups with travel expenses as well as accommodation in Core City. I'll be there with you too.\" Chambers sees the look on Ver's face, and asks uncertainly, \"What is it? Will you not be able to be there or something?\" \n\n\"Um...\"\n\n\"I think Norn is just worried about the competition ahead,\" Thoth answers smoothly.\n\nNishida also pats Ver reassuringly. Ver looks worriedly at Nishida, keenly aware of the fact that she, too, is part of the severely bounded world that is the hyperspace. However, Nishida simply smiles. \"Although we'll be nervous, as long as we're happy on stage, we'll be fine, right?\" \n\n\"That's right. There's nothing to worry about! Your opponents are the ones who have to worry.\" Chambers is clearly still riding the high from the auditions. \"You ladies are already so good. And with my plan...\"\n\n\"Hi, here's the food you ordered.\" \n\n\"Wow... That's a lot of food.\" \n\nSeeing that everyone is about to start eating, Chambers quickly announces the second reason for the celebration dinner: Luna has decided to embark on her idol career again. And thanks to her quick-witted action at the auditions, the company has promised her a job opportunity.\n\n\"I still don't know why I suddenly wanted to go on stage yesterday,\" Luna says, as she tries to recall what really happened. \"It felt like I saw someone and wanted to be like her... It was such a strange feeling, even though nothing special really happened.\" \n\nA look of puzzlement also appears on Chambers's face. \"Now that you mention it, I—\"\n\n\"But it's true that nothing special happened,\" Thoth calmly interrupts the two of them while giving Ver, who's not sure what to do, a look. \"Maybe you guys were just too mesmerized by the performances.\" \n\nVer doesn't respond immediately, but laughs out loud in a rather silly manner.\n\nEven though this is a man-made space and their encounter is going to be such a brief one... it turns out that she really can bring a smile to everyone's faces.\n\n",

Was it Nishida? \n\n\"Are you girls alright?\" \n\nAnd then there's that figure... is that Norn?\n\nJessica slowly calms down. She turns on her terminal, looks up the video of FIXing performing on stage, and starts to sing along softly.\n\nIt's alright, it's alright.\n\nThe super modern goddesses who will heal the world... Modifiers.\n\nYou may never stand in the spotlight, but like me, there will be many more girls who will do exactly that and who will have the power to bring smiles to others because of you.\n\nIt's good enough that you exist.\n\nJessica slowly closes her eyes as the white dust covers her and freezes her with her last smile.

You're the one who called me! ...Do you have a new idea or something?\" \n\n\"…You know, every so often I find myself picking my jaw off the floor because of the advancements made by modern technology.\" \n\nIt's only when I hear his voice that I realize that I've actually called him back without realizing it.\n\n\"Hmm, how do I put it...? Hold on, it's too noisy here... Let me find a quieter spot.\" \n\nHe manages to block out the noise for the time being.\n\nAs the person on the other end of the line is moving to another spot, I close my eyes and lay down on the sofa, enjoying the quietness of the moment.\n\n...Back when I was young and not yet famous, I was bombarded with all kinds of information in various places every day. I remember that sometime in the early years, some unscrupulous advertiser even wanted to plant advertisements into people's dreams... But thank goodness, after I decided to bite the bullet and spend a huge sum of money to install a complete, platinum-level suite of information management services in my home, my life returned to the tranquility that a fetus enjoys in the womb.\n\nWith the system, I can accurately tell which of the pieces of information being foisted on me are truly useful.\n\n\"Alright, let's talk. What's with you and modern technology now?\" \n\n\"It's been at least a year and a half since I last received an ad for this 'electronic anus with close-range defense capabilities.'\" \n\nThe reporter on the other side is stunned for a moment, then starts to laugh non-stop.\n\n\"Are you talking about the bionic arm designed to prevent you-know-what? I think that brand is very famous in Shashvat.\" \n\n\"I can't remember.\" I don't pay attention to things like brands. \"It really was such a huge mistake on my part. Back then, to collect material for my writing, I actually got myself a sparkling drink at a bar called 'Eagles Overhead.' And then I kept getting ads for this stuff for a whole year after that.\" \n\n\"Ha ha ha… so let me guess, are you planning to write about people's 'bedroom proclivities' in your next novel? After all, people are becoming more open-minded and are having fun in more ways now.\" \n\n\"No. To tell you the truth... I'm out of ideas.\" \n\nI glance at the calendar on the screen beside me, and count more than 15 days with crosses on them this month. This means that I haven't written any new and useful content for that many days.\n\n\"I've been reading a lot of science fiction writing lately.\" \n\n\"Mmhmm?\" \n\n\"I get the feeling that I'm getting out of touch with the world. Ever since '2Q50' became a commercial success I've been losing my drive and passion, along with some of my ability to sense what's going on in this world.\" \n\n\"'Passion'...? It must be so nice to be rich.\" \n\n\"That wasn't biting enough. What you should have said is, 'Thank you for loving both money and life to the degree that you do.'\" \n\n\"Ha ha.\" \n\nEvery time we trade barbs with each other like this, I can't help but think that humans are such strange creatures, for the better a relationship is, the more pointed the jibes tend to be. It seems that people always enjoy attacking each other no matter what.\n\n\"I don't have the time to quibble with you over language right now. But since you're hurting for ideas, why don't you come over to Molander and have a look around here?\" \n\nHe mentions a name that sort of rings a bell.\n\n\"Are you talking about the cordon CORG placed on Nordburg in Molander? I did look into it last week. Has anything new cropped up?\" \n\n\"Do you think I'd be here otherwise? Just get yourself over here. I promise this will give you some new inspiration.\" The reporter cannot help but say more softly, \"There's something really strange about this whole affair. If you're thinking of coming, better do it sooner rather than later. I've no idea how long I can hold on to what I have now.\" \n\n...\n\n",

However, there are a couple of minor surprises as we exchange information.\n\n\"Where's that 'thing' you told me about on the phone? Did you not bring it?\" \n\n\"Huh? When did we have a phone call?\" His query comes with a fair bit of confusion.\n\nIt's as if he has zero recollection of our phone call made just this morning.\n\nThe reporter and I both open up our phones dubiously, and find the \"Today\" column on the screen to be completely empty.\n\n\"Huh?\" This is just too weird.\n\n\"See? There's nothing here in the call history!\" \n\nSomething doesn't feel quite right. I start to examine my memories more closely. I got out of bed this morning, sat around in a daze for a bit, looked at my calendar, got into a bit of a fit, got on that phone call, took a quick shower, then booked my Photon Rail ticket for Molander... All these happened one after another, with no gaps in between.\n\n\"Do you really not remember anything at all? We even talked about that 'electronic anus with close-range defense capabilities.'\" \n\n\"What anus?\" \n\nHe's sitting right across the table from me, and now he's laughing non-stop for the second time today.\n\n\"Are you talking about the bionic arm designed to prevent you-know-what? I think that brand is very famous in Shashvat.\" \n\n\"You know, you just said exactly the same thing you did this morning.\" \n\n\"What? Please stop pulling my leg, my dear respected mystery writer, Mr. Fosse. I know a lot of writers like to say outrageous things just to provoke a reaction they can then observe.\" \n\nRight now, the emotion that I'm feeling at this development is neither anger nor confusion, but a kind of curiosity that I haven't felt for some time.\n\n\"I haven't written any mysteries for 15 days now.\" That last bit was added to underline my point. I continue: \"And as you already know, I'm not very interested in writing about people. Even if you were to make a cameo in one of my novels, you'd just be known as 'the reporter' or 'the editor.'\" \n\n\"You've no idea how grateful I am to you for that.\" \n\nBut in fact, I was indeed observing his reactions, and I see how he went from his initial confusion to doubt, then suspicion, and finally now to relaxation. Everything has been smooth and natural, and I haven't spotted any sign of falsehood. So, things get rather intriguing when such an interesting discrepancy arises between us.\n\nI shift into a more comfortable sitting position so that I can think this through more deeply.\n\n\"Now, let's suppose that something happened, that both A and B experienced, but somehow, only A remembers it. What usually would be the reason for this?\" \n\n\"What you just described doesn't sound real at all, so I'm guessing the reason is that A is pretending that he's actually experienced this with B.\" \n\nI can see the \"I know what you're really trying to pull here\" written all over the reporter's face.\n\n\"That makes sense. But allow me to add another possibility here: or maybe, part of B's memory for a certain period of time has been erased using some special method.\" \n\n\"How can that be possible?\" \n\n\"Fine. How about you tell me what you did this morning?\" \n\n\"I spent the entire time by the CORG cordon. I even ran up to a rooftop and used a drone to take a closer look at what's happening in Nordburg in secret.\" \n\n\"Have you been doing this for the past few days?\" \n\n\"Yep. You know, we reporters are nothing like the detectives you read about in the comics. Cases don't exactly fall into our laps from the sky.\" ",

Here, there are no AGI Mechas, no holographic screens, and no electronic patterns or information floating in mid-air everywhere. Instead, this small space of less than 100 square meters is filled with a real, simple, and pure beauty. There's even a delicate quill pen at the front desk.\n\nAt first, to collect more materials for my writing, I'd planned on seeking out some multimedia bookstores to see if I could find more clues from past news or something like that. But little did I expect that I'd encounter such a \"fundamentalist\" bookstore when I first pushed open the door.\n\n\"Um... hello? You are...?\" \n\nA girl with long brown hair cautiously pokes her head out from behind a bookshelf at the back of the store.\n\n\"...I'm just browsing.\" \n\nI knew almost immediately that she isn't the owner of the bookstore. Although she's neatly dressed, at first glance she looks like a student who's still in school.\n\n\"Is the boss here?\" I put aside the idea of ​​looking for clues for the time being, and try to make conversation with her instead.\n\n\"Oh? Do you know Captain Thoth? You must be from CORG too, then.\" \n\n\"I—\"\n\nI fight the urge to clear the air due to the couple of familiar names I've just heard. Judging from her tone of voice, she must be at least somewhat familiar with CORG too. Maybe she has a family member who works at CORG?\n\nAfter thinking about it for a long time, I finally gird my loins and reply calmly:\n\n\"...Yeah.\" \n\n\"Oh, I'm sorry, but Captain Thoth just went out. How about you hang around here for a bit until she comes back?\" She comes out from behind the bookshelf holding a book. \"I'm waiting for her too myself.\" \n\nI glance at the book in her hand. The title on the cover reads, \"National Consciousness, Uploaded.\" It's a bestseller science fiction novel that I read just some time ago. What I didn't know is that the publisher has also released a hardcopy collector's edition of the book.\n\nI continue pompously, \"I've never seen you before. Who are you?\" \n\nI'm Ve— Ah.\" She doesn't seem to be comfortable sharing her name with me. She looks at my arm first, then gives me an awkward smile and scratches her head. \"I'm sorry, but you can just call me 'V.'\" \n\nShe's so cautious with me, she's not even telling me her name. Looks like the jig is up?\n\nBut I take another look at her sincere and calm gaze, and I realize that's not it. Maybe she's not in a position to disclose her identity.\n\n\"...Sure. So, Ms. V, how much do you know about that cordon in Nordburg?\" \n\n\"Huh? That's where I came from… Captain Thoth and I came back together after completing our mission because there were Visbanes.\" \n\n\"Visbanes.\" That's a term I've never heard before.\n\nThere's no way I can keep up the conversation now. Although it feels a little too coincidental, it now appears that she's directly related to the cordon in Nordburg somehow. Asking more questions now would be too risky, since I might end up giving myself away instead. After much thought, I decided to retreat first.\n\n\"Got it. I think I'll come back for Thoth later. It's not an urgent matter anyway.\" \n\nI pick up a random book from a bookshelf next to me on the way out, quickly complete the self-checkout process, and exit the bookstore.\n\nIt isn't until I've walked some way away and am sure that the girl named 'V' hasn't followed me that I gradually relax.\n\nIndeed, unlike the detectives we read about in the books, we ordinary folks don't have the same quick-witted responses and sharp minds. Just a few words of conversation have caused a slight film of sweat to form on me. It feels like my brain is burning up a little.\n\n...And what in the world are \"Visbanes\"???\n\nI can't help but stop walking when I ponder this question. Looking back from a distance, I see the words \"Land of Moons\" written on the sign of the nondescript-looking bookstore.\n\n\"If I have the chance, I think I'll come again,\" I mumble to myself as I leave.\n\n",

Either I'll toss the book into the trash in a minute, or I won't move an inch until I finish reading it.\n\nBecause of this, with longer works I prefer to buy the serialized versions so that I can persuade myself to deal with other matters first.\n\n\"'The Comet'... is the name of its author 'Kay'? They seem to be a writer with great potential.\" \n\nI place the book down on the table and stretch my body a little. This book is the one I purchased during my escape from that \"fundamentalist\" bookstore, Land of Moons. It's turned out to be quite the unexpected gift, however.\n\nIt feels like a modern urban fantasy, what with its plot of a young girl, an avid book reader, who meets \"a boy who doesn't belong to this world\" after her friends and family meet with a disaster. It'll probably make an excellent romantic animated series if one can find the right production crew in Sasanami to work on it.\n\nMy neck has become a little stiff, so I move my head around a little. For some reason, I get the sense that I seem to have missed out on some important ideas.\n\n\"Hmm... Maybe I should look up the new terms I learned today.\" \n\nAs I fully exit my immersive reading experience, the term \"Visbanes\" immediately pops into my head.\n\n\"I hope the terminals at this motel are actually usable instead of being just decorative.\" \n\n\"...Thank goodness.\" The terminal starts up so smoothly, I can't help but be impressed by what was the cheapest accommodation I found.\n\nI start using various permutations of letters to search for \"Visbanes\" once I'm on the smart search engine page. But I soon discover that no matter how I search for the keyword \"Visbanes,\" all that are thrown up are things like educational toys, fashion, psychedelic music, and celebrity news...\n\nNone of the hits in the search results have a relevance score of 15% or higher. This is completely ridiculous. Even contraband items have a bigger footprint online.\n\nI get the vague feeling that something invisible has deliberately erased the concept of \"Visbanes\" from the internet. Of course, this feeling comes directly from my own book \"2Q50,\" where I tell the story about an existence beyond common sense, a thing completely terrifying. Whatever you think it is, it becomes.\n\nMight Visbanes also be a kind of memetic monster? I can't help but associate the two.\n\n(Sounds of communicator ringing)\n\nMy mobile phone suddenly rings, causing me, already in the middle of a horror fantasy, to feel a strong chill all over. I look at the screen, and I sit up immediately at the sight of the reporter's name.\n\n\"This is rather late for him to be calling... unless there's some new development...\"\n\n\"Hey, Fosse. Where the hell are you?\" The tension in the reporter's voice is coming through the line strong and clear.\n\n\"I'm in a motel on Molander Plaza. What's the matter?\" \n\n\"I need you to come pick me up right away. I'm in big trouble!\" I can hear the sound of frantic footsteps from the other end of the phone, and the sound of something rattling around in some kind of box, maybe. \"I'm walking toward the shopping street now. Let me check the time... 19... No, 01:14. We'll meet at the fountain at exactly that time!\" \n\n\"...Don't tell me you have a killer on your tail?\" \n\nMy tone is cheeky, but the muscles in my back have already instinctively tightened up. Something tells me that he's really in a sticky situation.\n\n\"No, all I can say is that I really am a freaking genius! Just come as soon as you can, man. Look, my phone may be tapped, so you must arrive right on time at 01:14, or we'll have to switch to another meeting place!\" \n\n\"Ugh, I can't believe you're making me run around like this at my age.\" \n\nI hang up on the call after making some grumbly noises, and then quickly put on my clothes. Despite my reluctance on the phone, I can't help but smile at myself as I do so. Guess I'm just the kind of person who likes trouble.\n\nI quickly walk out of the hotel. It's a slightly cool night, and I wrap my coat tighter around me. There is a long-lost feeling of excitement in me, one that is now infusing motivation back into my otherwise numb life.\n\n...\n\n",

In his arms he's holding a 20-inch suitcase, and as he walks, his eyes are darting left and right as if he's some kind of cat burglar. It's only when he spots me standing by the fountain that he finally breathes a sigh of relief and trots over to me with a huge smile on his face.\n\n\"Well, well, my dear old Fosse, I can't believe you got here two minutes earlier than I did! I wouldn't have believed it even if it were only a minute!\" \n\n\"Very funny. Keep talking like that and you'll learn what that 'electronic anus with close-range capabilities' feels like. \n\n\"Hahaha!\" \n\nIt's past one in the morning now, but the shopping street here is still a hive of activity. The reporter doesn't say anything more. Instead, he drags me through a lane and makes several turns until we come to the back alley of a bar. There's a foul-smelling pile of garbage not far away from us, and on a nearby wall there's an inconspicuous and rusty iron door that looks like it's been locked with a very old key.\n\nI watch the reporter deftly pull out a metal key from his pocket, open the door, and walk inside.\n\n\"Why do you even have a place like this?\" \n\n\"Work needs.\" \n\nHe throws the suitcase on a table and sits down heavily on the edge of a bed. \"You know, when you're shooting entertainment news, you always end up getting threatened and chased by the celebrity's lackeys. Then there's the problem of what to do when it's too dangerous for you to go back to your hotel and you still have an article due the next morning.\" \n\nThe room is small, around 20 square meters or so. There's only a bed, a table, and a terminal, which doesn't even look like it's connected to the internet.\n\nThere are also some instant meals and drinks piled up in a corner. I study the scene in front of me for quite some time, and find myself marveling at it.\n\n\"You sly fox, you.\" \n\n\"I swear, this isn't for \"afternoon delights\" or anything like that, man. I've scoped out this area, and all the surveillance cameras have been smashed by the drunkards who hang around here. So we should be safe for now.\" The reporter then retrieves a black box from under the table. \"There's also a signal jammer here.\" \n\n\"Although I don't doubt your loyalty to your spouse, and the world is now at peace... But the degree of professionalism you're showing here makes me wonder if you're a spy sent here by Lamashka.\" \n\n\"My dear old Fosse, what an honor it is to hear that from you,\" he responds flippantly.\n\n\"So, tell me what's going on.\" \n\nI sit down by the table and place the suitcase in front of me so I can study it.\n\nHis tone of voice immediately takes on a greater enthusiasm. \"You'd never guess what happened. It's been really thrilling tonight. I'm such a freaking genius. Seriously, I can't even believe it myself!\" \n\n\"Calm down and talk to me like a normal human being.\" \n\n\"Hey, don't you throw cold water on me now! Seriously, I think you can write this part of my story into one of your novels!\" With a gleam in his eye, he points to the suitcase that's now in my hands. \"You know, I didn't take all that talk earlier about erasing memories seriously until this suitcase happened to me!\" \n\nI stop what I'm doing, squint my eyes, and listen carefully to what he says next.\n\n\"So, earlier tonight, after I returned to my hotel room from the cordon, I realized that my suitcase was missing. It was bizarre. My shirts, pants, socks, wallet, ID and everything else were in a pile on the bed, but my suitcase was gone. And I couldn't figure out where it could've gone, since its only purpose was to hold all that stuff that was on the bed.\"\n\n\"Then, I looked everywhere for my suitcase. This is where it got scary: I realized that some of the anti-intruder measures I put in place had been triggered. You know, those tricks like placing a strand of hair or piece of paper behind the door? I learned those from your novels.\"\n\n\"Something immediately felt off. Because I'd leave my files and equipment behind at the hotel, I even made sure to tell them not to make up my room while I was gone. Later on, when I went downstairs to the front desk, they told me that they had indeed not entered my room as instructed.\"\n\n\"Freaky, right? So, if no one from the hotel entered my room, who did?\" \n\nThe space between my eyebrow furrows. \"So you mean to say that maybe 'someone'—like the secret police or a thief—had entered your room and taken your suitcase?\" \n\n\"No!\" The reporter suddenly raises his voice and points to the table. \"Ha ha, look, it's right here.\" \n\nHe's not making any sense.\n\n\"You won't believe this, but I'm the one who lost the suitcase!\" \n\nThe reporter is wearing a rather smug expression on his face at this point. As if he's sensed my complete befuddlement, he immediately starts to explain.\n\n\"...Late last night, I called for a courier pickup and sent a package!\"\n\n\"And the recipient of this package was also me! I'd chosen the \"Secret VIP\" service, and asked that the package be sent to me at exactly 12 o'clock tonight... Oh, or rather, 12 o'clock last night.\"\n\n\"So, my dear Fosse, why do I say I believe you now? It's because I really don't remember doing it! The courier from Olympia Express told me that I was the one who'd handed the suitcase to them last night, and I was the one who'd placed the order in person. But I have no memory of either of these things! So I didn't just lose a morning's worth of memories, but at the very minimum, all my memories from between last night and today!\" \n\nNow that he's finally done unloading all the facts on me, he stands up, grabs himself a drink from the corner, and pours the water into his mouth greedily.\n\nAs he does so, I start thinking as I stare at the suitcase.\n\n\"So, you actually had this 'very important thing' last night, but because you felt it was dangerous or unsafe, or out of an abundance of caution, you decided to have it take a short tour of Molander's logistics system, and it came back to you tonight?\" \n\n\"That's right! And you haven't heard the best part yet!\" \n\n",

And now, my curiosity is piqued again.\n\n\"I can't tell you how utterly thrilling it was! When I got the suitcase back, I realized that I'd changed the lock code, but I no longer remembered what it was. So I just sat on my bed holding it and got to thinking. I don't know why, but the more I thought about it, the more scared I was, and the more worried I became about my situation.\" \n\n\"As you know, since someone had been to my hotel room earlier that day, they must have found something. Although I had no idea what was inside that suitcase, it had to be something very exciting! So, since they'd already wiped my memory, would they also know that I got the suitcase back?\" \n\n\"That's a logical line of thinking.\" I can't help but express my approval. \"If we follow the usual methods of private detectives in novels, the person who'd entered your room would most likely be in the room next to yours.\" \n\n\"That crossed my mind too! Totally felt chills down my spine when I thought that.\" He squeezes the drink can in his hand so hard, I can hear the sound of it being crushed.\n\n\"…But here you are now, completely safe and in one piece right here in front of me.\" \n\n\"Yeah. Let me tell you, at that time I really was... it was like I was possessed by some strange force, and it made me walk over to the window and take a look downstairs.\" A grin breaks out on his face. \"Now that I think about it, and this might have been a man's sixth sense... I looked out, and saw a few men in CORG uniforms entering my building!\" \n\n\"Oh?\" \n\n\"I felt something was wrong, and so I ran away with the suitcase in my arms. I didn't even stop to put my clothes on properly! I ran to the elevator and saw that both elevators were going down, so I knew they were coming up. I immediately went down the fire escape, all 24 floors of it!\"",

The main premise of the show is, competitors work in pairs to evade Ain Soph police for as long as they can with the basic supplies and money they're given. Whoever stays out of the hands of the police beyond a certain time will win a huge prize.\n\nThe program was extremely popular at the time, with hundreds of thousands of people signing up for it. But in the end, very few pairs managed to stay out of the reach of the police beyond 24 hours.\n\nModern technology is so advanced that within the city, anywhere that is not private property would almost certainly be surveillable. If they really want to, they can certainly tell you just how much time you've just spent at a certain public toilet. Of course, this is also why Ain Soph has an extremely low crime rate. The price of this is that each and every one of us is living in a veritable panopticon.\n\nThis is the predicament I find myself in now.\n\nAs a fugitive, I must ensure that I'm not caught on surveillance in any way. So, I decide to travel west overnight, and find myself at Molander's famous West Coast Beach Resort.\n\nAt least on a beach that stretches for several kilometers, there's unlikely to be much camera surveillance.\n\nThanks to this, I'm finally able to get a good night's sleep after I uncover an unrented tent in the resort campground and decide to rest there in secret for the night.\n\nDespite my mistaken belief that I've finally found a safe place where I can finally try to crack the nine-digit lock code of the suitcase at my leisure, as the afternoon rolls around, my last hope is dashed.\n\nA very eye-catching piece of news has appeared amidst the news programs and ads being played at the resort: \"Renowned author William Fosse disappears in Molander.\"\n\n\"Damn. They're even willing to make up stories just to find me?!\" \n\nIn the newscast, the presenter first runs through a list of my works, then states that I was in Molander to attend a writers' gathering recently when I disappeared \"unexpectedly.\"\n\nNow, my face has been blown up into various digital images at least thirty feet tall and posted on street signs and billboards everywhere. There's even an interview with a visibly excited official from the Molander city government, in which he says that he's a \"diehard fan of Mr. Fosse's books\" and expresses his \"grave concern for Mr. Fosse\"...\n\nWhat follows is a missing person notice issued by the Molander police which states that anyone who manages to find Mr. Fosse will receive an enormous reward.\n\n\"I can't believe they're going this far!\" \n\nI am so mad, my face is all pressed up against the screen. All I can see and hear is, \"you're not going anywhere!!!\"\n\nI can already foresee what's going to happen next.\n\nThose content creators who shoot on the streets will surely stop everyone with their cameras in the hope that they can 'catch' William Fosse and get their hands on the advertised bounty. Now, everyone in Molander will be keeping an eye out for me. Who knows, maybe they might just get lucky?\n\n\"Looks like I can't stay here any longer.\" \n\nI turn back for one last look at the beach. The evening breeze is blowing, and the crowds are slowly leaving the beach and returning to the resort. This is probably one of the most crowded places in Molander. While there's no proper surveillance, now every person here is effectively a surveillance camera on legs.\n\nI decide to stay here for just one more night and then leave this awful place for good.\n\n",

Both of them look a little older than V, but no more than 20 years old. This makes me suspicious for a moment, because it is my understanding that the young ones these days aren't into the classical and elegant things, let alone bookstores. In fact, don't kids these days shy away from books?\n\n\"Are you... William Fosse?\" One of the other two girls with long ash-green hair looks up at me.\n\n\"That's right. I'm that missing person the entire city is looking for thanks to that fat reward. But please don't call the police. I don't want to… I'm deliberately hiding my whereabouts now,\" I ramble.\n\n\"No, Mr. Fosse, I know you because of your work. I've read your Detective Charlotte series cover to cover twice. I'm impressed by the ingenious ideas and plots that you've come up with.\" She smiles and gets on her feet, then bows slightly. \"As a writer myself, I regard you as a senior whom I respect very much.\" \n\nShe seems to attach great importance to courtesy, and this makes me, currently covered in a layer of dust and dirt, feel a little ashamed.\n\n\"I'm just a useless old man... Anyway, please don't call the police.\" I smile awkwardly, then turn to look at the shocked girl next to me. \"I'm sorry, Ms. V, I lied to you two days ago. I'm actually not from CORG. I'm just a very curious writer who was trying to get some information out of you.\" \n\n\"Huh??? What? WHAAAAAAAAT????\" Ver starts whimpering.\n\n\"I'm the owner of this bookstore, and the Thoth you were 'looking for' the day before yesterday.\" The girl with long ash-green hair smiles and puts her hand on V's shoulder, then turns to me and asks, \"How can I help you, Mr. Fosse?\" \n\n\"...So. I have a suitcase here with me. It has a nine-digit combination lock with quantum encryption.\" I raise the case in my hand slightly and continue, \"This is something very important that my friend has entrusted to me, and I need to find a way to open it. But right now, I'm unable to.\" \n\n\"Why?\" \n\n\"To be honest with you, because this is probably something that belongs to CORG, or at the very least, something important to them. In fact, this is probably the reason why I've been declared a missing person and a huge reward has been offered for news of my whereabouts.\" \n\nThis confession is a move I made after much calculation. After some of the things I saw on the beach the day before, my gut feeling is that they, or at least this girl called V, are not the type of people who'd drag me to the police station.\n\nI mean, she may have a secret even bigger than mine.\n\n\"Let me guess, it's something related to Nordburg?\" Thoth ventures.\n\n\"I've no idea. Or rather, no one has any idea until the suitcase is opened.\" ",

This money will help us last at least another week!\" \n\n\"My pleasure. Besides, you folks are the ones who're helping me.\" I show her the suitcase. \"I've finally found a way to open this thing, the root of all evil.\" \n\n\"If it contains dirt on CORG, then I hope it's serious dirt that will blow up in their faces.

I'll write up an article later to help you create more awareness.\" \n\n\"I am so grateful for your help.\" \n\n\"Let's keep going, we're falling behind.\" \n\nIn Xu Heng, there's an idiom that means \"to come back from the brink,\" and in the past two days, I've truly experienced the meaning of this idiom.\n\nAfter I left the bookstore, I was discovered by CORG when I inadvertently stepped into a surveilled area. So I started running again. I ran and I ran, from noon to late at night, and in this time, I seemed to have picked up all the skills a fugitive needs to have. I changed outfits, put on a disguise, took a circuitous route, and even used a decoy... Finally, I managed to find the group of protestors near the CORG cordon.\n\nI told them everything that'd happened to me. This, and my appearance and identity, gave the group everything they needed to embrace me unquestioningly. I may not have been a resident of Nordburg, but I was still a victim of the incident nevertheless. (From their perspective, I'm a courageous writer who's on a mission to uncover and expose the ugly truth and is now hunted and persecuted by CORG... Well, they're not entirely wrong.) \n\nThanks to them, I finally had a proper meal for the first time in three days, as well as a good bath and a good night's sleep. Not only that, I also found a way to crack the lock on the suitcase.\n\nThings always have an unexpected way of resolving themselves—my story of how I came upon the suitcase caused quite the ripple among the protestors when I first told it to them, and everyone was deeply sympathetic to my experience. And everyone was of the opinion that the suitcase definitely contained some important secret and maybe even key information that could help them in their protests against CORG.\n\nAnd so, in the blink of an eye, this exquisite black briefcase became a \"holy relic\" for the protestors (they even prepared a gift for the reporter, calling him \"the warrior shining a light in the darkness\"). Now, they value the safety and importance of this suitcase even more than I do. It is such an incredible relief to have found them and to feel so safe with them.\n\nLater, a young man named Niles told me about a high-end computing power module used by hackers sold at a very famous prosthetic hospital on Sudburg's shopping street. Although the module, meant for use on prosthetics, is extremely pricey, it is said that cracking a code encrypted at the level deployed with the suitcase lock is a cinch if one has a prosthetic equipped with such a module.\n\nI decide to give it a try.\n\nSo, together with all the protestors, I draw up an \"escort operation.\" It will take two days for our demonstration to get from the blockade to the shopping street (as the distance and speed we're permitted to move each day is restricted by law). Obviously, it's all just a cover for me to receive the implant surgery.\n\nI'm full of energy, and can't wait until we get there.\n\n",

The full price is usually around 24 million.\" \n\n\"I'm sorry, I think I need a bit more... clarification. Because I've never spent more than 1 million coins in one go, and from what I've been given to understand, even the most expensive prosthesis is no more than a few hundred thousand.\" \n\nIt's all I can do to keep my cool. Because this price is basically everything that's currently in my bank account.\n\nI'd always believed that having earned over 17 million from writing would have classed me as the \"super-rich.\" I mean, I'd done the calculations before—even if I never work again, it's enough money for me to live off for the rest of my life.\n\n\"I did make this proposal based on the requirements you gave me, sir. You specifically stated that you didn't want a purely mechanical structure, nor did you want implants, so advanced bionics and nano-biomaterials are the best options for you. This program has been clinically proven for more than a century, and is essentially guaranteed to have no complications.\" \n\n\"What's the difference between this solution and a mechanical prosthesis?\" \n\n\"Cognitive delirium and safety, sir. The one thing mechanical prostheses will never be able to solve is what they are themselves. No matter how you look at it, a mechanical prosthesis isn't made from your body's own tissue and so, on a subconscious level, there's no difference between it and fitting a prosthesis to an amputated limb. You may have heard of the phenomenon of \"phantom limb pain\"—this is exactly the same principle. This is one problem our centuries of modern medicine have still failed to solve.\" \n\n\"There's a risk of mental illness, and you need to take medicine and suppressants. I know that much.\" \n\nI had actually seen the mechanical prosthesis option in the package. It involves completely replacing the triangular piece of tissue between your shoulder and neck with metal and circuitry that interface directly with the spinal nerves, as well as a very thin artificial nerve fiber running all the way to your brain under the skin, passing through the cerebellum and implanting in the occipital lobe.\n\nMaybe I'm overly squeamish, but even just the thought of having a lump of metal stuck in my brain makes me feel a bit sick. But now I'm faced with another dilemma. Is it worth me spending everything I have just to install this hacker module so that I can open a busted old briefcase with 9-bit quantum encryption?\n\n\"What are the other advantages to this solution besides safety?\" \n\n\"You'll live longer, sir.\" The consultant fishes another report out from the folder. \"These are the full results from your medical. As you know, your circulatory and nervous systems are already showing signs of advanced aging. You're 52 years old. Based on your current physical condition, I predict you have fewer than 30 years left ahead of you. But this life-support system will give your body access to nano-level organ and tissue repair, and with it I see no reason why you shouldn't be able to safely reach the theoretical maximum human lifespan.\"\n\nYou've got to admire these modern sales reps. Not only do they know their products inside out, but they also know how to manipulate your emotions and weaknesses. As soon as I told them what it was I wanted, they went out and designed a new set of specifications that had nothing to do with my original requirements. Who cares about opening a silly case when you could get an implant that extends your lifespan?\n\nObviously I'm just a layperson, so even though I know exactly what their sales methods are, I still find the promise of immortality difficult to resist.\n\nBut the price of this is literally everything I have.\n\n\"When would you like to start the surgery, Mr. Fosse?\" The door to the consultation room suddenly flies open and in runs the head of the protest group.",

        "desc": "\n\nBANG!\n\nA large anti-riot canister slams into the corner of an old building next to me, and before I know it I'm surrounded by smoke and dust. I don't stop running, and turn the corner at the intersection to make my escape. The police hovercar that's following me gets stuck between the walls of the narrow alley, and the sound of it recedes into the distance as I run.\n\n\"#@%*!\" \n\nIf that canister had hit me, it would have broken a bone or knocked me out at least. I curse to myself as I sprint down the alley. When I hit the street on the west of Molander Plaza, I cut horizontally through the crowd to head northwest. That's where the Land of Moons bookstore is, and it's my only hope.\n\nHow did things get like this?\n\nI'm not sure. In fact, I don't think anyone is.\n\nHalf an hour ago, I was standing in the lobby of the prosthetics hospital trying to crack the encryption when CORG soldiers entered, closely followed by protesters who barged them to the ground and began fighting. In the chaos, another protester grabbed my hand and dragged me out of the hospital. All he'd tell me is that the group's leader had been detained, and that something has happened in Nordburg to make CORG enforce a mandatory evacuation of the area.\n\nWe fled the scene like frightened stray dogs.\n\nThis is no longer the covert operation we'd planned. With the police hunting us down and erecting blockades in the streets, it's more like a giant game of cat and mouse in broad daylight.\n\nI can tell my new implant is working to reduce my feelings of fatigue, but my temporary companion isn't so lucky. He's hit by another anti-riot canister and crumples to the floor. I want to save him but there's nothing I can do—what's important now is that I get away with the briefcase.\n\nI know I can simply put the case down at any time and come out with my hands up, and I won't be hurt. But I'm not giving up that easily. I've spent everything I have and given up six days of my life to see what's inside this briefcase—I can't turn back now. And if I can only guarantee my safety by attacking CORG soldiers, then so be it.\n\nIn order for me to get from the shopping street to Molander Plaza, I have to pass through the Saint Sophia Medical Center. It was actually this very street where I made my decision just a few days ago.\n\nMy left hand is still connected to the combination lock, in the hope that the program is still running while I make my escape. I can see the progress bar is nearly two thirds done. Success is literally right before my eyes.\n\nBut things don't always turn out the way we want them to.\n\n\"Mr. William Fosse, please stay where you are.\" \n\nTwo people have turned onto the end of the street and raise their weapons at me.\n\nI curse under my breath. The police car is still far behind me, and I doubt these two are actually planning on shooting me. I slow down as I approach them and pretend like I'm going to surrender, and just as I reach them I shoot off.\n\nJust like I thought, they had no intention of shooting me, and instead I barge them to the ground. I hold the briefcase behind my head to block any bullets that may come my way, and continue to run.\n\nI'm less than 500 meters away from the Land of Moons bookstore. I don't care anymore if I'm going to cause trouble for the girls there. I feel like a grasshopper in the park, jumping furiously to avoid being trampled by children. Besides, the decryption is almost complete.\n\n\"Hng!\" \n\nMy left hand is suddenly much lighter, and searing pain shoots up my arm like it's about to be torn from its socket. I lose my center of gravity, causing me to stumble and roll on the floor.\n\n\"CORG Egregious Crimes Department! Stop where you are!\" \n\nIn confusion I look behind me and see a CORG soldier encased in a metallic exoskeleton. He stands as firm as a boulder, holding the case in his hands.\n\nMy heart skips a beat.\n\nI look back in front of me in despair—the bookstore is just across the street. I was so close!\n\n\"#@%*!\" \n\nI clench my fists and force myself to stand up.\n\n\"Mr. William Fosse, don't make another move! Put your hands on your head and await processing!\" The soldier with the briefcase makes no attempt to move, and barks orders at me instead.\n\nSo they did only care about the case after all.\n\nThere's no way I'll be able to fight them for it, but at least I can still escape! And then I'll have the chance to think of a way to get the briefcase back from them.\n\nWith my mind made up and my body heavy, I half-run, half-hobble over to the Land of Moons bookstore.\n\n...\n\n",

I've told them to stay put and await further orders. You can relax now, Mr. Fosse.\" \n\n\"Can I? Because unless I'm very much mistaken, you're also with CORG, Ms. Thoth.\" \n\n\"I'm head of the Egregious Crimes Department's Field Ops team. But in addition to that, I'm also the owner of this establishment.\" She says this without arrogance, and instead motions for V and I to sit at one of the reading desks in the corner.\n\nI'm not quite sure how I should be handling this situation. After a long silence, I reluctantly ask the most pressing question in my mind.\n\n\"Why aren't you arresting me?\" \n\n\"We've had everything under control since the beginning. Besides... You probably have a lot more questions you want answered before we wipe your memory, right?\" \n\n\"Does that mean...?\" \n\n\"Are there any messages you'd like to leave your future self before your memory's wiped?\" \n\nI don't know what technological device she uses, but a pile of papers from another desk suddenly flies up in the air and drifts over to us. She plucks them all down and places them in front of me. I'm also handed a brand new pen.\n\n\"Authors can shrug off all kinds of suffering and hardship, but depriving them of inspiration or material is a fate worse than death. I know a little bit about how that feels, so let me help you out.\" \"I assume you still remember how to write?\" Thoth asks me gently. \n\n\"I think so.\" \n\nI pick up the pen tentatively.\n\nBefore I put nib to paper, I close my eyes and think back over everything that's happened these past few days.\n\n\"What questions can I ask you? And what can I write down?\" \n\n\"You can ask me anything, but I suggest you only write down what will help you with your work.\" \n\n\"Got it.\" \n\nMaybe after today, the word \"Visbane\" will be permanently erased from my memory, so I imagine it as something incredibly dangerous and give it another name before jotting it down.\n\nThe first sentence I write on the paper is: What would happen if there was such a thing as memory erasure technology?\n\n\"There's only one burning question I have, Ms. Thoth. My briefcase—well, the journalist's briefcase, to be precise—what's inside it exactly?\" \n\n\"According to department records, it's a banned video showing a battle between Modifiers and Visbanes. Due to its violent and graphic content, it is scheduled for confiscation and destruction.\" \n\n\"It's a shame you stole it from me before I had a chance to watch it.\" \n\n\"Believe me when I say we've done you a favor, Mr. Fosse. Visbanes are truly terrifying. If details of them were to get out, there would be mass panic.\" \n\n\"Exactly!\" V, who's standing next to us, chimes in. \"Mimir often brings back many prohibited videos about Visbanes, and it often takes the Admin and I hours to sift through it all!\" \n\nThoth chuckles as she shakes her head. \"And now Mr. Fosse is going to be wondering: who is Mimir? And who is this Admin?\" \n\n\"Hm? Oh... I was wrong.\" \n\n\"None of that has anything to do with the new book I'm writing.\" I tactfully change the subject with: \"So am I right in thinking that you're both 'Modifiers'?\" \n\n\"That's right.\" She gives me a direct answer. \"You can think of us like ordinary humans who, when Visbanes appear, step forward to make sure nobody gets hurt.\" \n\nHer description reminds me of the superhero comics and movies I loved as a kid.\n\n\"So, that evening when I saw Ms. V fighting that white monster on the beach... That was a 'Visbane'?\" \n\n\"That was a Realm... Actually yes, you can think of it as a Visbane.\" V says with a grin.\n\nI can't help but blurt out, \"You were awesome, V.\" \n\n\"Eh?\" \n\n\"Oh nothing, it's just that I was hiding in the resort so I saw everything. It's not the kind of thing I'll forget in a hurry.\" \n\n...\n\nI don't think I've ever had such a fascinating afternoon.\n\nThe inspiration is flowing, I'm in the zone, I'm like an inquisitive toddler constantly asking 'Why?' \"What is it?\" \n\nI've already filled up twenty pages of the notepad. It might look like a load of nonsense, but it's actually all been carefully curated and contains countless ideas and materials. It's been so long since I've felt the satisfaction of actually having my curiosity sated.\n\nThe afternoon sun is beginning to stream through the kitchen window and warm the back of my hand, and I squint at its warmth. I find myself daydreaming about how I'd made the impulsive decision to run to the edges of the world and spend my entire fortune. Now I see it wasn't really because I wanted to find out what was in the briefcase, but because I'd rediscovered a curiosity about the world that I'd thought I'd lost long ago.\n\nIf someone were to ask me tomorrow what I'd spent my millions on, my reply would be, \"Buying back my soul.\"\n\n...\n\nAn agent enters the bookstore holding some kind of electronic device, and walks over to me.\n\n\"Mr. Fosse, I've looked over this and there's no problem that I can see.\" Thoth gathers the papers together in a folder and hands it to me.\n\n\"Thank you.\" \n\n\"Before your memory is erased, have you decided what your next book is going to be about?\" \n\n\"That's the million coin question, isn't it?\" I laugh. \"Yes, I know what it's going to be about, but you're going to wipe my memory. Still, I'm reasonably sure I'll be able to piece it together from these notes.\" \n\n\"So this is the author? So what is your next book going to be about?\" V asks curiously.\n\n\"Let me think. I think it's about an ordinary person who has the courage to discover and expose a fake world.\" \n\nAs I get to this point, a new idea suddenly flashes to life in my mind.\n\n\"Sorry, I missed out a sentence.\" \n\nI take the notes out of the folder, pick up a pen, and quickly scribble down a sentence at the top of the first page.\n\n\"Thank goodness I'm a human and haven't lost my desire to find out more about the world. This is how I know I'm still me.\" \n\nThis is what I want to be the message on the cover page.\n\n\n\nEnd.\n\n",

        "desc": "\n\n\"Do you know what the secret to a happy life is?\" \n\n\"Hard work, progress, and stay humble.\" \n\nEvery morning he practically leaps out of bed, takes a second to admire the hustle and bustle of the outside world from his window, then showers and gets ready for a full day of working hard and living life to the full.\n\nAs he showers, he always hears the beep of a notification on his terminal informing him that today's installment for his prosthesis payment has been taken. Not long ago, he'd decided to have a brand new hand prosthesis fitted in order to help him do better at work. Not only is he faster at everything he does now, but his ability to think and calculate also seems to have improved. All for just the price of one meal per day! This is the fourth prosthesis he's had implanted, but the first that's designed to do more than just make his life easier. Of course, it was also twice as expensive as the last one he'd had fitted in his head. When they gather for a meal after work, his colleagues always ask him where the prosthetic came from. He doesn't want to show off, but he knows what they're thinking.\n\nHis performance at work has been steadily improving, and he's clearly caught the attention of senior management. He's also been at the company for longer than most of his colleagues. The day before yesterday marked the final repayment for the very first prosthetic he ever bought, seven years ago. He hadn't been with the company very long at that point and didn't know which to choose, so he listened to the advice of a senior colleague that turned out to cause him to lag behind his peers. Luckily, he put in the work and was still able to progress, while that work-shy senior colleague was quickly fired. Now, everything is on track and his life is getting better by the day.\n\nAfter his shower, he makes his way into the small yet cozy living room, where the cooker he'd set up last night is in the process of making breakfast for him and his parents. His parents had bought this house when they were young. At the time, they were considered relatively wealthy because they still had money left over from their salaries after paying the mortgage. However, they both lost their jobs in the subsequent economic downturn, and even though they tried to make a living from home, the family was undoubtedly much worse off than before. His parents blamed themselves for this, believing they hadn't worked hard enough to be able to weather the financial storm. That's why they'd always taught him to study and work hard, ever since he could remember, so that he could get a stable job in a big company.\n\nAnd that's exactly what he did, so that now he can afford a better life for himself and his parents. Now his mother doesn't need to cook breakfast in the mornings and his father doesn't need to keep cleaning the living room carpet, because they have smart machines to do all of that for them, and the decor can be changed at the touch of a button. Without the distraction of humdrum chores, he's able to fully focus on working hard for a better life.\n\nJust like every other morning, after breakfast he clips on his communicator and tells his parents he'll be home from work as early as he can so they can go out for a stroll together, then kisses them goodbye.\n\nHe locks the door and takes the elevator down from the 46th floor to officially start his day.\n\n",

It climbs 2 meters in 1 hour, then while it's resting it slides back 1 meter. How long will it take the snail to reach the top of a 10 meter well?\" \n\nThe question suddenly pops into Niles' brain.\n\nIt's a simple enough math question, even back when he was 6. When he was 22, a job interviewer asked him the exact same question. He considered it carefully, then gave a thorough answer from multiple angles. The interviewer was impressed, and he eventually got the job. In the years that followed, he would often think of that question when he needed motivation. His desire to climb higher than everyone else drove him to be more productive and waste less time at work.\n\nNow, Niles is realizing that, in order for the snail to even start climbing in the first place, it needs to be in contact with the wall of the well. So if he wants to do well in work, he needs to be where all the work is.\n\nNordburg in Molander City has been sealed off by CORG.\n\nThere was a massive explosion, but no one knows what caused it. Was it an alien invasion? An accident at a chemical factory? Secret experiments? Rumors abound, but CORG are giving no official explanation.\n\nBut he doesn't care what CORG may or may not be up to. He only cares about his job. But CORG are preventing him from working, preventing him from going home, even. This won't do.\n\nSome of the displaced Nordburg residents have banded together and decided to stage a protest march from the emergency camp to the blockade to demand it be lifted. The head of the protest movement is a young woman called Bysha. She always wears her ponytail high on her head, which makes her look like she means business. She's already submitted the protest application to Molander City Council, and is now busy recruiting people to her cause. Niles' tent is near hers. The first time she gave a speech in the camp, he was lying in his sleeping bag and listening to every single word. He was the first one to come out and sign his name on the application.\n\nHe wants his job, his life back.\n\n...He wants it all back.\n\n\"What are you just standing there for, Niles? It's not like you to be slacking off!\" Someone gently nudges him in the chest with their elbow. Niles turns and sees Trikk grinning at him. \"I thought you would've come up with three different strategies for handing out flyers by now.\" \n\nTrikk is one of his colleagues, hired by the company just two years ago. They've worked together ever since and have grown quite close, so naturally they still hang out even when there's no proper work to be done. Trikk is very passionate about the protest, although he tends to get lazy when it comes to the admin side of things. He's always been like this though, and luckily Niles is always there to take things over the finishing line when Trikk starts to get bored.\n\n\"Why don't you finish handing out your own flyers first, and then we can talk strategy,\" he says, somewhat wearily. Niles hasn't had any energy since being relocated to the emergency camp, and sometimes he'll just feel depressed all of a sudden. He attributes this to his less-than-ideal living conditions. Pounding the streets obviously isn't the best job in the world, and although he trains in the gym from time to time, the feeling of the sun beating down on his neck makes him feel nauseous, and just reminds him how far removed he is from his comfortable former life in the office.\n\nBut he's just going to have to get over it. The flyers were cheap to print—it's the man hours needed to distribute them that are valuable. He needs to make sure he gives them to the right people. Niles activates his head implant and data begins to scroll above his hand as it analyzes the other pedestrians walking down the street. Different languages, faces and conversations crowd in around him, and he almost feels like he's floating...\n\nSuddenly, he hears a woman's voice in the distance say, \"You know, it's not a good idea for you guys to be doing this.\" \n\nTrikk is standing in front of a brown-haired woman. Her plait reminds Niles of Bysha, except Bysha's is much shorter and usually brushes against the base of her neck. The pedestrians who don't care about the protesters' cause either wave at them as they pass, or quickly duck down side streets to avoid them. But this girl, holding the flyer Trikk had given her, is patiently explaining her point of view. \"CORG must have a good reason to seal off Nordburg. Maybe it's really dangerous. You should just stay away and let them do their jobs.\" \n\n\"A good reason? They haven't given us a single reason why they've stolen our lives from us!\" It looks like this conversation has been going on for a while, because Trikk looks like he's at the end of his tether. \"If you Sudburg folks actually had a shred of empathy in you, you wouldn't be standing here spouting nonsense at me! The next time your parents die and CORG just say it was \"an accident\", then you'll understand how we feel!\" \n\nThis outburst stuns the woman into silence, and the surrounding Sudburg residents begin to frown in their direction. Niles walks over and pats his comrade on the shoulder. \"Don't be so hard on her, Trikk. It's not like she works for CORG.\" \n\nThe woman fidgets with her hands nervously and says, \"Thank you.\" \n\n\"Instead of thanking me, I'd much rather you read what we have to say on our flyers,\" Niles says, pointing to the piece of paper in her hand. \"We Nordburgers have been kicked out of our homes. We've lost our jobs and any way to make money.\" \n\nThe woman bows her head as she reads the flyer, and when she next speaks there's a note of sadness in her voice. \"How could they... do that to Nordburg?\"\n\n\"We've filed an application with the Molander City Council to stage this protest. Molander is Nordburg and Sudburg's shared home. We hope we have your support. We have to get our lives in Nordburg back...\" \n\nThe woman nods and Niles laughs internally at how Trikk seems to have accidentally found the easiest person to convince in this city. There are still some people standing around watching the interaction, and Niles takes the opportunity to hand out even more flyers. \"You should watch what happens to us carefully! What happens in Nordburg today could happen in Sudburg tomorrow!\" \n\n",

Bysha pokes her head through the flap in his tent, her hazelnut eyes shimmering.\n\n\"Quite good, I'd say. We've explained things to everyone in the other camps, and it was much easier to get into Sudburg today than it was before. But the people there just don't understand our cause.\" Niles reactivates his head implant. \"How are you?\" \n\nBysha grimaces and says, \"Oh... You wanna go for a walk?\" \n\nIt's already dusk, and the fence CORG erected along the blockade casts its long shadow over one side of the camp. Bysha walks in this shadow, her eyes downcast. \"The route for the march has been approved.\" \n\n\"They didn't want us to change it? That's great!\" \n\n\"It is. Everything has gone according to plan ever since we began organizing the protest. I just...\" Bysha turns to look at him. \"Niles, do you think what we do is actually going to make any difference?\" \n\nMake a difference?\n\nDoesn't everything we do make a difference?\n\n\"Of course it will!\" Niles says, \"Bysha, think of our past, of how we got to where we are now. No one better than us understands how every little action can make a difference. We just need to stay focused, stay determined, take one step after another and eventually we'll reach our destination.\" \n\n\"You always say that,\" she replies, her ponytail hanging down on her shoulder. \"But this isn't school, this isn't the office. We don't even know why CORG have done this, and small fry like us don't have a chance in standing up to them...\"\n\n\"But at least we can try,\" Niles grips his right hand, and it feels like the prosthesis there is burning. \"Hard work might not get you everything you want, but doing nothing will get you nothing. I don't want to end up with nothing, Bysha...\" \n\n\"At least we can try...\" Bysha shakes her head and stares at something in the distance, deep in thought. \"...They're not going to listen to us if we stay quiet.\" \n\nAfter a while, she sighs quietly. \"The protest will be in 2 days' time. Are you scared?\" \n\n\"Scared? Why would I be scared?\" \n\n\"Okay, well are you nervous then?\" Bysha smiles. \"Forget it, it's too late to be nervous now. Let's talk about something else. Where's that dessert place you were telling me about? For when we get Nordburg back...\"\n\n\"I'll take you there.\" Niles grins. \"And there's a really good bookstore next door, as well as a holographic experience. The guy running it really knows his stuff, and they have some really interesting photographs.\"\n\n\"Do you like photography?\" Bysha flings her hands outward and pirouettes over to Niles. \"I love watching musicals. I wish people would just suddenly break out dancing in real life.\" \n\nHer ponytail arcs gracefully through the air as she spins. She begins to hum a melody and claps her hands to the beat. Niles remembers the song from a musical set in the rain, and he feels his heart beat in rhythm to the tune. The outline of an opportunity begins to form in his mind. \"I like that one too.\" \n\n\"Really? I've watched it so many times, and I always zoom right in so I'm dancing right there alongside them. It's just a shame I'm always on my own, so I have to alternate doing the male and female parts of the routine.\" \n\nAs the words tumble out of Bysha's mouth in excitement, Niles extends a hand to her and says, \"Care for a dance?\" \n\n\"Beep beep!\" \n\nNiles' terminal suddenly begins to ring, and snaps them back to reality. Bysha sticks out her tongue and pulls her hand back. \"Is that an important message?\" \n\n\"No, I accidentally set my alarm for the wrong time.\" Niles waves a dismissive hand, and hides the one with the terminal behind his back.\n\nEver since he moved to the camp, he's changed the reminder for his prosthetic repayments from the morning to the evening. His bank balance is continuously going down, and without a job there's nothing coming in to bump it back up again, so now he feels his anxiety increase with every beep of his terminal. But it's fine, he has enough in there to sustain himself for a while. He just needs to get back to work and everything will go back to normal again...\n\n\"Niles? Niles!\" Bysha is waving her hand in front of his eyes. \"Are you okay? What were you daydreaming about?\" \n\n\"I... Huh?\" Niles quickly lowers his gaze.\n\n\"Sorry, I think I've just been overdoing it lately. These past few days have been a lot.\" Bysha's hand drops. \"You should get some rest, and you should probably turn off those implants if you're not using them. Come on, let's head back.\" \n\n",

        "desc": "\n\nBysha's voice comes up from below. \"How's it looking?\" \n\n\"There's a ton of people, way more than I thought.\" Niles lowers his binoculars and comes downstairs, yawning. \"We should be good to officially start in half an hour.\" \n\nTrikk stands to one side, glancing at the middle-aged man in disguise in the crowd. \"Do we really need to change the route just for that writer guy?\" \n\nYesterday, an author in disguise called William Fosse came to the protest camp looking for refuge, as CORG are looking for him in connection to some secret briefcase. In order to help him break into the case, Bysha submitted a last-minute amendment to the protest route and Niles was forced to stay up late writing three different statements. Fortunately, the march was still allowed to go ahead.\n\n\"It's another way for us to get back at CORG, we'd be fools not to take it.\" Bysha grips the placard in her hand. The rally hasn't succeeded yet, so there's no smile on her face yet. She looks over the crowd solemnly.\n\nFinal preparations almost complete, Bysha walks over to the crowd and Niles is the first to start shouting the slogan. Banners are waved, angry shouts rise, and the march kicks off. The march starts from the blockade in Nordburg, heading for Sudburg in the south. Sometimes they walk forward silently holding up their protest signs, and sometimes they stop to rest. Some of the protesters have brought simple musical instruments and sing songs about home and hope. At the start, there was no one to watch the march besides CORG soldiers, but as time goes by more and more Sudburg residents come out to see what's going on. Some are curious, some are scared and walk away, and others are angry at the inconvenience and shout slurs at the protesters. But what hurts Niles the most about their stares is the fact that no one really cares about their plight at all. They all still have their homes, their jobs, their favorite shops and bars... What does he have? A job that might not exist anymore, debt that grows heavier by the day, the memory of being hounded from his home by CORG soldiers, and the accident...\n\nAll good reasons why the Nordburg blockade needs to be lifted.\n\n\"Free Nordburg\" Give us back our homes!\" \n\nThey march and chant all day until their feet and lungs are on fire. Niles runs the gamut of emotions. His body is exhausted yet his mind is clearer than ever. He feels like he's floating just above a burning flame. In the evening, the protesters stop at a park to rest. Niles is ordering others to distribute some supplies when Bysha suddenly comes up to him.\n\n\"Niles! I've got to talk to you!\" Her voice is hoarse from shouting all day, but I can still tell it's higher pitched than normal. Her face is glowing with so much excitement she almost looks a little drunk. Realizing she's attracting the attention of other people nearby, she reigns herself in a bit and beckons Niles over.\n\nNiles looks regretfully at the supplies being distributed, but Trikk pats him on the shoulder. \"Go, I'll handle this.\" \n\nNiles runs after Bysha, who leads him around corners and past tents until they reach a spot where no one can hear them. She finally stops and turns to face him.\n\n\"What's the matter?\" Niles asks, slightly out of breath.\n\n\"Something's happened.\" Bysha pretends to be deadly serious, but seeing the worry on Niles' face makes her crack and she bursts out laughing. \"Something good!\" \n\n\"Something good?\" \n\n\"Yes!\" That drunk-with-excitement look is back on Bysha's face. \"CORG have agreed to talk with us.\" \n\nNiles' mouth drops open in astonishment. He doesn't know how to take the news. On the very first day of the protest too? They've geared themselves up for a near-impossible task, have gotten themselves prepared for a fight that could take years, and they've succeeded before they've even finished drafting their initial action plan?\n\n\"I thought we said there was nothing we could do to affect CORG's profit margins, and it would be extremely difficult to extract any concessions from them?\" Niles says, his tone uncertain.\n\n\"Who knows? Maybe there were lots of journalists watching today?\" Bysha, who is much shorter than Niles, tilts her head up to face him and grabs his hand tight. \"I think it's weird too, and there's no way we're gonna succeed first time round, so I've decided not to tell the others about it yet. But it's happened so fast that we must have touched some kind of nerve for CORG somewhere... So even if this round of talks ends in nothing, we must be doing something right and we need to set out our case logically, and explain to them exactly what we want and what our terms are.\n\nWe can't let this opportunity slide.\" \n\nBysha's hazelnut eyes flash in the light of the setting sun, and a frisson runs through Niles. \"When are the negotiations due to start? We need to start preparing right away!\" \n\nBysha winces and says, \"In three hours.\" \n\n\"Three hours?! So soon?\" \n\n\"That's what they wanted.\" Bysha looks stressed, but determination creeps into her voice. \"So let's not waste any more time. Believe in yourself, Niles.\" \n\n",

        "desc": "\n\nIt's the dead of night.\n\nThe street lights and shop windows lining the Nordburg blockade are unlit, shrouding the road in an inky blackness that Niles' eyes can't penetrate, no matter how hard he stares out of the car window. He has no idea where he's being taken, and no landmarks to guide him.\n\nSo instead he turns on the screen on his hand implant to read the data from there. He's feeling nervous, excited, and a little ill at ease.\n\nIll at ease because of the person driving him and Bysha to their destination. The driver is a well-dressed man, that is to say, he doesn't look like a homeless beggar like the rest of the Nordburg evacuees have become.\n\nWhen they'd met, he'd smiled and said, \"I'm the acting chairman of the Molander Business Alliance.\" But before Niles and Bysha could say anything, the smile had disappeared and he'd climbed into the waiting car.\n\nNiles isn't sure why a chairman has been sent to be their chauffeur, but he knows why CORG chose him and Bysha as the protesters' representatives—after all, they were the ones who'd rallied the camps together and organized the march.\n\nBut why send this guy?\n\nIt's true there was a lot of commerce in Nordburg, a lot of companies that people like Niles and Bysha used to work for. Those businesses will also have been severely affected by the CORG blockade, so it makes sense that there'd be suits at this meeting. It will only help strengthen the protesters' case... won't it?\n\nThere are no answers to the questions flying through Niles' head. Bysha is sitting next to him in silence. Niles forces himself to focus on the presentation they've prepared and what he's going to say. Time had been so tight that he and Bysha had only been able to run through it once, but he's confident they'd managed to pull together all the information they need: everything they've experienced so far, the latest news from the past few days, stories they've heard in other camps... All of this has now become their evidence and their weapon. Not to mention the fact that everyone is behind them, their requests are reasonable, and there's a bottom line that they refuse to compromise on...\n\nThe car slowly comes to a stop, and they see the CORG building illuminated like a beacon in the darkness. Niles takes a deep breath and gets out of the car.\n\n\n\n\"Please, follow me.\" \n\nA CORG soldier in uniform shows them the way. The chairman goes first, followed by Niles and Bysha. Ordinary citizens like them have only ever seen CORG on the news. The closest they've ever come to meeting someone from the organization is when they've gone to the Molander City Council to fill in some paperwork. The building's design is simple and businesslike. The corridors are studded with display cases housing prototype weapons, adding to Niles' gnawing sense of unfamiliarity and fear. He grits his teeth.\n\nHe and Bysha are brought into a lounge area and instructed to wait there. Niles continues to leaf through their prepared presentation. The chairman gets up and wanders off. Time crawls by, and the agreed appointment time comes and goes. Niles grows increasingly anxious, and one look at Bysha tells him she's feeling the same.\n\n\"What the hell is going on?\" Niles whispers.\n\n\"No idea,\" Bysha replies, her fingers clasped so tight her knuckles are white. \"Why are they keeping us waiting?\"\n\nNiles doesn't answer, and thinks back on all the stories and information they've collated. Suddenly, he stands up and goes to the door. Bysha follows him, but they're stopped by the soldier standing guard. \"I'm sorry folks, but this is a research institute with lots of hazardous areas. I'm afraid I can't let you go wandering around. If you continue to wait, someone will be with you shortly.\" \n\nNiles eyes the gun the soldier is carrying. \"When are the negotiations due to start?\" \n\nThe soldier furrows his brow in confusion. \"The negotiations? They started a while ago.\" \n\n\"They've already started? But we're still here. Who is CORG negotiating with then?\" \n\nNo sooner has the question left his lips than Niles realizes the answer.\n\nThe \"acting chairman of the Molander Business Alliance.\"\n\nIf he's the one CORG actually want to negotiate with, then what have the protests been for? Who actually cares about him, about Bysha, about all the people of Nordburg who have been kicked out of their homes and living in temporary camps?\n\nHad they just been brought in as a bargaining chip, or as a set dressing to inspire sympathy?\n\nRage begins to boil inside him, and he's about to continue to go out the door when Bysha preempts him and charges past the soldier into the corridor. As they do, another door opens and the \"chairman\" walks out with a middle-aged man.\n\n\"Wait! You have to listen to the people...\"\n\nBysha's sentence is cut short as several guns appear and point in their direction, so close they can smell the cold metal of the barrels. Before she can shout anything else, the two men have disappeared.\n\nIt's as though they hadn't even heard Bysha, as if these two representatives of the Nordburg people didn't even exist. As if they're not important enough.\n\n\"Take it easy guys, we don't want to hurt you,\" the CORG soldier says. \"But like I said, it's dangerous around here. Please go back into the visitors' lounge.\" \n\n\n\nSo what was the outcome of the negotiations? Who knows?\n\nWere the displaced people in the camps even mentioned? Unclear.\n\nWill there be more talks? No one can tell them.\n\nBysha slumps into one of the soft couches and stares blankly at the ceiling. After a long silence, she seems to think of something and says, \"The march will continue as planned tomorrow. We promised Mr. Fosse we'd get him to the shopping street. Besides, there are too many people waiting in the park for us now. We can't let them down.\" \n\nNiles looks at her numbly. \"Even if it's all pointless?\" \n\nBysha is stunned into silence. Her eyes dart left and right as she thinks furiously, her cheek muscles twitching. Finally, she says through gritted teeth, \"This doesn't sound like you... The very least we can do is try. There'll be other ways, other methods... We can't just give up like that.\" \n\n\"The very least we can do is try...\" Niles murmurs to himself.\n\nThis sentence is only really true if there's at least one tiny shred of hope that things can change for the better. Even if the chance of success is 1 in a hundred, or 1 in a thousand, or even 1 in a million, then yes you should grab it.",

Niles exits his tent, and sees that no one has organized breakfast or taking down the tents. Everyone seems on edge. From the snatches of the various conversations Niles can hear, it would appear that a new consensus has arisen among the protesters since he's been gone:\n\n\"CORG aren't going to listen to a nice, well-behaved protest. It's time for us to show them we mean business!\" \n\nIt's normal for emotions to run high during a protest march, but what he's hearing doesn't bode well. The more people there are, the more they need to be organized in order to achieve their full power. But Niles doesn't know how to quell these fires, because deep down he's feeling exactly the same thing.\n\nIf he hadn't have been a coward yesterday, if he'd have shouted, broken down doors, strangled a soldier with his prosthetic arm... Would things be any different today?\n\nEver since he was a boy his parents had taught him to follow the rules. Follow the rules at school, at work, the rules set by the Ain Soph government, the invisible rules of society... By following the established path and working harder than other people his age, he had a better life than other people his age. He found a way into the black market and bought a prosthetic hand that was far more expensive than he could afford just so he could get ahead at work, but not once did it cross his mind that this hand could also be used to break the rules.\n\nHe's no longer living in a world dictated by rules.\n\nNiles tries to hold himself together as he goes to organize the distribution of supplies. After a while, Bysha emerges in the crowd. But she doesn't excitedly wave at Niles like she normally does, and neither does he. He has the vague feeling that lots of tiny cracks have appeared between them, and he can no longer envision them going to the dessert place and hologram exhibition together.\n\nOnce the supplies are pretty much in order, Trikk appears sheepish. Niles knows he was probably slacking off, but he himself doesn't have the energy to say anything about it. He stands among the crowd of people in something of a daze, wondering when the march will start. Just as he's lifting his arm to check the time on his terminal, shouts rise up and people start moving.\n\nNiles stands still for a minute before following them.\n\nThe protesters are angrier than they were yesterday, and attract more attention from passers-by. Some Sudburg residents, unhappy with the disruption the protest is bringing to their day, stand in the streets and shout insults. One of them deliberately blocks the march route with his vehicle, and sits inside laughing while the protesters angrily swarm him. The Sudburg residents are smiling, the models in the billboards are smiling, the shop signs are smiling, the Business Alliance is smiling...\n\n\"They're arresting Fosse!\" someone shouts.\n\n\"CORG are arresting us!\" others cry out.\n\n\"They're attacking us!\" The voices become screams.\n\n\"Screw you, CORG! Get lost!\" \n\nNiles doesn't know who shouted first, nor who threw the first crumpled up ball of paper. But it triggers a chain reaction of increasing severity. The curses get louder, and then placards, kettles, rocks, anything that comes to hand is hurled toward the CORG soldiers. Furious anger sweeps the crowd, including Niles. He'd spent all night trying to find a solution, but all that was left in his brain was CORG's laughter and slurs. His tired body is suddenly filled with energy, and the strings that seemed to be tying his limbs down are cut off. Niles drops everything he's carrying, snatches a bottle from Trikk and throws it with all his strength. As his right arm extends in front of him, it seems for a second that he's reaching out for something beautiful—or liberty.\n\n\"BANG!\" \n\nFlames explode on the CORG soldiers' shields and screams ring out. Niles' mind goes blank.\n\n...What had he just done? Attacked the security forces?!\n\n\"Niles!\" A voice shouts at him from the left and he sees Bysha fighting her way through the tumult. She grabs his right hand. \"Where did you get that Molotov cocktail from?! ...I thought I'd hidden them all!\"\n\n\"Molotov cocktail?\" Niles repeats the phrase like he'd never heard it before, and looks down at his hand. Only then does he equate the fire with what he'd just done. His brain takes a second to catch up, but it suddenly hits him that they've lost all control of the situation...\n\nThere's no time.\n\nBricks and even more Molotov cocktails begin to fly. Some people charge forward, some fall to the ground, and there's a loud hissing noise as the tear gas canisters are deployed...\n\n",

It's tiny, the mattress is so thin he might as well be sleeping on the metal frame, and the walls feel like they're exuding cold. He can't see anyone or anything else apart from some electronic scanners behind him.\n\nHe feels like he's completely awake, but he must be asleep. How else can he explain the fact he's lying in his bed at home, and sees breakfast ready on the table when he opens his eyes? The next second he realizes he's going to be late, and he's running for the elevator with Bysha. He makes it in time but she doesn't, but instead of going up it falls endlessly.\n\nHe awakes with a start on the cold, uncomfortable bed, but his arms and legs are weak as though he were still in that falling elevator. Rubbing his arms, Niles relaxes a little, although he still can't believe he's in a place like this. He hears a screech as the steel door to his cell is opened, and a CORG soldier enters.\n\nNiles is taken to an interrogation room.\n\nHe is sat on one side of a table, opposite a woman with ash-green hair wearing some kind of CORG uniform.\n\n\"Niles Evans.\" She flips through a file, regret etched on her face. \"I never thought the next time I saw you would be in a place like this.\" \n\nNiles snaps his head up and looks at his interrogator. Something about her face causes ripples in the depth of his subconscious memory, and an unnamed fear wells up inside him. He blurts out, \"B-but I've never seen you before in my life.\" \n\n\"What?\" Her jade green eyes stare unwaveringly at him. \"...How long's it been since you properly slept? And I mean, real deep sleep. With your implants switched off and everything.\" \n\nNiles doesn't understand why she's asking him this. He clasps his head in his hands and looks at the desk, avoiding her gaze. \"I didn't sleep well last night, or the night before... So, two nights I guess.\" \n\n\"Are you sure about that?\" \n\n\"I...\"\n\n\"Have you had any real sleep since the day CORG locked down Nordburg?\" \n\n\"Maybe not, because I've been worrying about work...\"\n\n\"Niles Evans,\" she interrupts his delayed response, but she slows her voice down too, as though she doesn't want to overstimulate him. \"Try and think. Has anything been missing from your life lately?\" \n\n\"Of course it has! My house, my job, everything about my old life...\"\n\n\"Anything else? Anything extremely important?\" \n\nAnything else?\n\nNiles presses his fingers into his temples and the past comes flooding back to him unbidden. Every morning he practically leaps out of bed, takes a second to admire the hustle and bustle of the outside world from his window, then showers and gets ready for a full day of working hard and living life to the full.\n\nGet up, look out the window, shower, repayment notification, leave the bedroom, breakfast, arrange a stroll, go downstairs...\n\nWait, who was sitting next to him at breakfast? And who was he arranging to go on a walk with?\n\nHe can feel the scars of something terrible, and collapsed buildings, and a terrified cry that pierces the cozy daily routine like thunder. \"Niles, run!\" \n\nNo, it can't be. That never happened...\n\n\"Niles, your parents gave their lives pulling you out of that crevasse. Was their sacrifice all for nothing?\" \n\n\"NO!!\" \n\nNiles lets out a gut-wrenching scream and curls up in his chair, shaking. The chains to his handcuffed right hand clink together gently.\n\n\"Spontaneous memory loss of a traumatic event... It's rare, but long-term prosthetic use and extreme tiredness could cause it.\" The interrogator closes Niles' file and sighs gently. \"This radical behavior of yours has worked, by the way. Public opinion is on your side, and a date for lifting the blockade has been set. It's just a shame you don't know who made all this possible. CORG aren't going to press any formal charges, this time...\n\nI hope your life gets better, Niles.\" \n\nHope.\n\n",

The sun, which he hasn't seen for two days, shines bright in his face, and he holds up his hand to block it out until he gets used to being in the outside world again.\n\nHe walks aimlessly down the street, and stops at a corner to look at himself in the convex mirror. He sees a bloated and exaggerated reflection of his face: unkempt, greasy hair, days-old stubble, shadows under his eyes, and crumpled, dirty clothes.\n\nThe models in the billboards are still smiling, and the residents of Sudburg are still going about their daily business. It wasn't long ago that he was just like them, but now he wants to shrink away from their stares.\n\nWhere can he go? That's right, that interrogator lady... Thoth... said a date has been set to open Nordburg up again. He should go back to the emergency camp. Maybe Bysha's back there too. If only he could get his job back and go back home, his life would slowly return to normal... It has to, right?\n\nNiles turns on his terminal (which had been blocked these past two days) to check directions on the map and is bombarded with notifications—pointless news stories, interesting news stories, sales notifications, hologram ads, repayment notices... He mindlessly swipes to close them all, until a familiar logo jumps out at him.\n\nIt's an email from his company.\n\n\"Dear Mr. Niles Evans,\n\nDue to the severe negative impact on our company's reputation following your recent violation of CORG orders and company regulations, we have decided to terminate your contract...\"\n\nNiles is dumbfounded. He must have misread it. He closes the message and reopens it, rereads every word carefully, then double-checks the email address and electronic stamp on the attachment.\n\n...It's genuine.\n\nHe's lost his job.\n\nIt's been his dream to work for this company since middle school. He began seriously preparing for it at college, was hired as soon as he graduated, and has put his heart and soul into it for seven whole years. He's never taken a day off sick, barely took his vacation days, and was always the first to volunteer for overtime. His performance was improving by the day, he paid for prosthetic implants to boost his productivity, his colleagues were jealous of him and his managers praised him...\n\nAnd just like that, it's over. No discussion, no payout... Just an email.\n\nHis ears begin to buzz unbearably, and a sharp pain splits through his head. He squeezes his fingers to his temples, sick with dizziness. Out the corner of his eye, he sees someone leaving the store carrying two full bags of shopping.\n\n...Trikk?\n\nThat's right... It's all his fault! He was the one who gave Niles the Molotov cocktail!\n\nNiles is consumed by a blind, self-destructive rage. It doesn't matter anymore, none of it. With a roar, he leaps forward and grabs Trikk by the throat with his enhanced right hand, lifting him up and slamming him against the wall. Trikk drops his groceries. Donuts roll down the street and milk spills everywhere.\n\n\"It was you! You made those Molotov cocktails!\" \n\n\"St-stop...\" Trikk manages to wheeze out, his eyes wide in terror as he scrabbles at Niles' hand around his neck. \"The company made me do it!\" \n\n\"The company?\" \n\nIt's like Niles is seeing Trikk's brown eyes and curly hair for the first time, and he realizes that his smiling face has always masked the anxiety in his eyes. \"The company said they'd give me a raise if I got the bottles out and gave them to you, and I figured you'd definitely be able to find a better job if you got fired so... But I didn't know they wouldn't give you a payout, and I never dreamed that the Molotovs would have made Bysha...\"\n\nNiles' blood is still boiling, but he's starting to feel like Trikk is pouring cold water on his rage. \"What's wrong with Bysha??\" \n\n\"Haven't you seen the news? Bysha was the one who made the Molotovs. She says she was told to do it, but she doesn't have any evidence, not even a single message. She's been locked up, and they think she's going to get the death penalty...\"\n\nWhy would Bysha have made Molotov cocktails? Before all this, she was just an ordinary office employee like Niles. The company, CORG... the Molander Business Alliance!\n\n\"No, Bysha didn't do it. It was him! But there's no proof... Of course there's no proof... The Business Alliance itself doesn't even exist...\"\n\n\"Niles, what are you talking about? Snap out of it!\" \n\nNiles releases his grip and Trikk collapses to the floor. As he struggles to get back up, Trikk sees to his horror that his once reliable colleague is waving his arms in the air, laughing manically with tears in his eyes.\n\n\"Niles... H-have you gone mad?\" \n\n\"...Have I gone mad?\" \n\nNiles calms himself down and brings his arms back down to his sides.\n\n\"No, I'm not crazy, I'm fine... I just have to get back to work, I need to get my old life back...\n\nHard work, progress, stay humble... That's a happy life...\"\n\nHe turns around and walks off.\n\n",

What if the top of the well is far higher than 10 meters? And what if someone is waiting to flick all the snails back down again as soon as they get near the top?\n\nThe reason the snails climb up is because they can see the light at the end.

He feels the fiery alcohol burn its way down his throat as he takes yet another swig.\n\nHe feels his body heating up, and it's like he's floating up into a warm, weightless, hazy world. He hears music. It's one of his favorite holo-songs, colorful images playing before his eyes in a montage. He gets out of bed and has breakfast with his parents. He's doing so well at work that his managers and colleagues are giving him high fives in the hallway. He strolls down the street with his parents in the evening. He bumps into Bysha in a dessert place and they begin singing and dancing like they're in a musical. They sing as everything around them crumbles and dance as the world collapses, with CORG agents and Molander Business Alliance entrepreneurs as their backing artists...\n\n\"Hey, wake up, you filthy northerner!\" A heavy hand slams into the table as a group of onlookers begins to form. \"Go back to your tents. You're not welcome here in Sudburg.\" \n\nThe man sprawled on the table doesn't reply but instead opens another bottle with a lopsided grin on his face, which is rightly interpreted as brazen mockery. This infuriates the ringleader even more, who reaches out to shove Niles. He falls to the floor and takes the table with him, bottles and drink spilling everywhere. The men roar with laughter, and some of them pick up the bottles and pour their contents over Niles' head. \"Typical northerner. Cowards who've never done a day's hard work in their lives and just come here to cause trouble. CORG might have let you off, but Sudburg will never forgive you!\" \n\nNiles shakes his head, but his vision is still blurred by the alcohol he's consumed and the alcohol running down his face. He can vaguely make out the people around him—they're wearing suits and laughing down at him.\n\nThey're the ones who plotted all this, they're the ones who took Bysha from him. They must pay...\n\nNiles staggers to his feet and picks up a broken bottle with his enhanced right hand.\n\nA beeping sound rings out, but nobody notices.\n\n\"Dear Niles Evans,\n\nDue to changes in your terms and conditions, your prosthetic repayment plan is now in arrears. In order to avoid any adverse effects on your credit score, please repay the entire outstanding amount of your loan by the following deadline...\"\n\n\"Wh-what are you doing?\" \n\n\"AAARGH!!\" \n\n\"Help!! He's crazy!\" \n\nNiles can still hear the wonderful music in his head. He spins and dances in the pouring rain, and everything he's lost spins and dances with him.\n\nAs the song ends, he smiles and waves his hands, raindrops dripping from his fingers.\n\n...\n\n...\n\nHe doesn't remember when it started raining.\n\nThe neon street signs glow invitingly in the rainy night, except for this alleyway entrance that's cordoned off with police tape. Sirens scream past and pedestrians scurry past under their umbrellas, afraid to stop and find out what's happening down there.\n\nA gunshot rings out, muffled by the sound of the pounding rain.\n\nThoth holsters her weapon and looks at the body lying on the floor. She had seen this young man's face only a few days ago, and now he would never breathe again.\n\nShe sighs.\n\nThe unmistakable smell of blood is diluted by the rain, which washes it from the street into the Molander sewage network.\n\n",

Research basis\n\n1.1 Branching space theory\n\n\"Branches\" are observable world structures generated by Gaea that are similar to the Axis World. The existence and observability of branches have already been discussed in chapters 2, 3 and 6 of the Idealbild Observational Analysis.\n\nIn chapter 10, we reported on the phased increase and stabilization of total redundant data, which coincided with the time frame when branches were observed and lost. We can thus postulate that branches are created during the normal course of Gaea's activity, and are subsequently erased for reasons unknown.\n\nRecords show no obvious pattern in the timing of branch creation. However, database association analysis reveals that branches tend to be generated when major historical events occur, which suggests a certain degree of correlation.\n\nFurthermore, analysis of the redundant data structures leads us to believe that branches are composed of similar data to that of the Axis World. This would suggest that branches probably contain a global architecture and are able to operate autonomously.\n\n...\n\n2. Feasibility analysis\n\nThis study seeks to reproduce global conditions at important historical time points, and use data backups to construct observable and recordable branches. Following a detailed evaluation of our current technical capabilities, we believe that it is feasible and meaningful to construct such branches.\n\nWe have previously confirmed the feasibility of historical data extraction in the Idealbild Observational Analysis. Based on existing research into Gaea's structure, we believe that building a static world at a single time point is a feasible goal, and that the predicted computing power required does not exceed the site's current capacity. Data backups will allow us to create the redundant datasets needed for the creation of artificial branches.\n\nGiven the patterns and characteristics observed in branch generation, it is speculated that branches are alternative offshoots when major events occur in the Axis World. Artificial branch construction will enable us to recreate the world as it was at a specific time point in the past, and then observe how Gaea functions under those conditions so as to help solve legacy problems from our history.\n\nAlthough it is still unknown why branches disappear and what the possible consequences of creating them are, our records show that branch generation did not result in deviation in the Idealbild, nor did our previous observations result in harmful consequences, so the overall risk level has been deemed controllable. We believe the urgency of achieving the primary objective outweighs any potential risks.\n\n...\n\n3. Study objective and timeline\n\nPrimary objective:\n\nLocate the Council of Observators.\n\nSecondary objective:\n\nSearch for clues as to the source of the Visbanes.\n\n...\n\n",

Experiment terminated.\n\n\n\nConclusion\n\nWe have reached the following conclusions from this initial branch construction test:\n\n1. The site is capable of extracting and exploiting historical data, but this caused an unexplained increase in the Idealbild Deviation Rate. Following a team discussion, we decided to abort extraction and proceed with branch construction using the data we had already pulled back until we found a solution to the increased deviation rate.\n\n2. Gaea has some way of monitoring branches and will forcibly delete active ones, which explains why past branches disappeared for no apparent reason.\n\n3. A significant increase in computing power and incoming data were detected at the observation port, which we believe to be related to Gaea activity. Preventing this may facilitate branch construction.\n\n4. The operating logs demonstrate that the data spontaneously transmitted by Gaea is executable, which we believe to be linked to the subroutine responsible for deleting branches.\n\nIn light of the above, we conclude that branch development is still in its infancy and that further technical adjustments are required. Our technicians believe that Gaea ensures its uniqueness by exerting control over its world construction program and forcing deletion whenever it detects similar programs.\n\nDue to unforeseen issues with the Idealbild, we had to abort all historical data extraction and rely on what data we did have to construct and develop artificial branches, which required full exploitation of existing resources and data backups.\n\nAs a result, we decided to iterate our branch construction technology and set up an isolated environment to block Gaea's monitoring sequences and intercept any deletion programs. Our search for deletion programs found no records in existing databases, which is a first in our observation of Gaea. A breakdown process has now been launched.\n\n\n\nProposed rectifications\n\nAfter a team discussion, the following improvement plan is hereby proposed to counter Gaea monitoring and interference and thus ensure successful branch construction.\n\n1. Set up an isolated environment for branch construction, and filter data to block Gaea monitoring and interference.\n\n2. Modify the construction program to integrate a camouflaged shell to bypass Gaea monitoring.\n\n3. Intercept deletion programs to prevent interference with branch construction.\n\n4. Analyze the existing data, assess target feasibility, and adjust priorities accordingly.\n\n...\n\n",

A Data Plane Layer equipped with an integrated mapping program is capable of blocking Gaea monitoring, significantly prolonging branch survival.\n\n2. World construction requires more computing power and storage than expected; we do not believe the site currently possesses sufficient capacity to build a complete world.\n\n3. Gaea can detect system overloads, resulting in almost immediate failure of the isolated environment. Power consumption must be strictly monitored and regulated.\n\n4. Performance of the security protocol is poor, and the deletion program is more complex than we originally believed.\n\nIn light of the above and the partial data available to us, we do not believe it possible to construct a full branch world with the current resources at our disposal. Expectations for this project need to be managed. Suggested first steps include focusing primarily on localized regions and improving technical R&D.\n\n...\n\n\n\nProposed rectifications\n\nAfter a team discussion, the following improvement plan is hereby proposed to construct a branch world given the limitations on computing power, and refocus on our primary objective.\n\n1.

With the successful construction of Molander City, the primary objective has been modified to \"Search for clues as to the source of the Visbanes.\"\n\n3. Shrinking the scope of construction has reduced the computer power and storage requirements to acceptable levels.\n\n4. Cross-checks against the database confirmed that the data generated in the branch is identical to that in the backups, with no deviation.\n\n5. However, it was not possible to populate the branch with biological organisms without soul data.\n\n6. The observation results did not meet expectations, as it was impossible to observe the branch from outside its isolated environment.\n\n7. The security protocol demonstrated improved performance, as it was able to prolong the branch's duration upon detection of a deletion program, although it ultimately failed to ward off Gaea's interference.\n\nIn light of the above, the department director has judged it impossible for us to achieve the desired objectives with a static branch world, and that it is not possible to exploit all currently available data resources.

That one I just took is nice, you should give it to the Admin when you get back.\" She turns and leaves.\n\n\"No no, absolutely not! Delete it now! Thoth!!\"\n\nVer goes running after her. Back in the room, sunlight filters through the fluttering curtains, passes through the window, climbs over the bed and casts a golden glow through the open door, before disappearing into shadow.\n\n",

        "desc": "\n\nIf there's anywhere in the world that has been left untouched by time, it'll be here. That's not to say it hasn't physically changed (because it has), but it's more like the feeling it gives people hasn't changed. Although the eerie light floats and contorts in an infinite space, it gives people a sense of enduring peace, like time has stood still. The floating platform in the center seems to be in a constant state of disintegration and evanescence without ever truly changing. The process of fracturing itself has been arrested in a hopeless, silent annihilation.\n\nYet in this seemingly immutable space, a crimson crack suddenly rips through the air, like the opening of an otherworldly, vertical pupil peering in to size up the space.\n\nA man with silver hair slowly emerges from the rift. Though his stature is undeniably minuscule compared to this space, his entrance seems to exert a pressure that briefly bears down on every inch of it. A woman steps out after him. She follows his gaze to the island floating midair.\n\n\"Turing, sir, is this...\"\n\nWithout answering Gremory's question, Turing softly takes a step forward. In the blink of an eye, he's appeared atop the platform. Another moment later, Gremory is beside him. The Structure stands silently on the platform, yet its very presence is a rousing call.\n\nTuring's eyes, usually sedate, shudder involuntarily in this moment with unconscious excitement. Finally, he speaks: \"I sensed it, its call...\"\n\nA moment's rapture flashes through Gremory's eyes as well when she hears Turing say this. \"At last!\" \n\nJust when they're about to approach the Structure, Turing senses something else. He turns to look at another area of the platform. There, he sees another rift open and a girl leading a team dressed in CORG uniforms steps out. Both parties stand firmly in place when their eyes meet—clearly, neither expected to meet another living soul in a place like this.\n\n\n\nThis is the liveliest this space has ever been.\n\nTightening his grip on his weapon, Raphael steps forward slightly. \"Captain Thoth, care to introduce us?\" \n\nRaphael says this, but he knows full well that no one capable of so brazenly entering this place is likely to be a friend.\n\nPursing her lips, Thoth looks at the two of them, greeting them in answer Raphael's question. \"Turing. Gremory.\" \n\nHaving never met Thoth, Turing is rather surprised to abruptly find himself called by name. While Gremory has met Thoth, the fact that she knows of Turing is equally surprising to her.\n\nDespite this, Gremory quickly regains her composure and turns to Turing. \"Turing, sir... She's one of the Modifiers I met before. I don't know where the other two girls are, though.\" \n\nTuring gives a slight nod as he looks at the self-possessed girl before him. \"How is it, exactly, that you know who I am? Not even a Prime would know of my existence, let alone utter my name. And yet you, a weak little nobody, not only found this place, but even called out my name...\"\n\nTuring's words, though cutting, don't convey a shred of disdain or disparagement. As far as Thoth can tell, he's simply stating his suspicions with earnest objectivity.\n\nMobilizing all her Divine Power, Thoth looks at Turing and says: \"I think you would know better than me that nothing in this world defies explanation, however strange or unlikely.\" \n\nTuring says nothing, though the fact that he permits Thoth to continue speaking suggests that he agrees.\n\nThoth thus continues: \"So, the fact that I'm here and know your name says, at the very least, that I may give you more trouble than you may expect.\" \n\nAs she speaks, Thoth discreetly gestures to Raphael and the others that they should step back. Raphael sees this, but rather than back away, he steps forward slightly.\n\nThoth doesn't know whether to laugh or cry: Looks like these guys are due for a refresher course on military discipline when we get back.\n\nThoth continues: \"I'm guessing trouble is the last thing you want right now. So, how about it, Turing? Shall we have a chat? \n\nTuring's eyebrows raise slightly. \"You know who Gremory and I are, and yet, your first impulse is to have a 'chat' with us. To be quite honest, I never thought I'd hear that from a Modifier.\" \n\nThoth laughs. \"It shouldn't be that surprising—We can't defeat you, and you can't kill us right now without drawing unwanted attention to yourselves. Besides, none of us is about to give up on what's right in front of us. So, why not have a chat?\" \n\nJust as Turing is about to respond, the entire room suddenly starts to shake. They all look up to see countless Realm Cleansers descending from the sky.\n\nTuring's pupils dilate slightly. \"That's...\"\n\n\"Turing!\" Thoth's voice snaps Turing out of it. \"Ten minutes. Join forces with us to defeat those things then give us ten minutes to collect the data, and we'll withdraw immediately. Whatever you do, we won't interfere.\" \n\nTuring stares at Thoth for a moment, then slowly speaks: \"You're right about one thing—I have no desire to get pulled into a pointless dispute. I hope you're as good as your word, Thoth.\" \n\n",

After all, paperbacks were relegated to the realm of nostalgia years ago. Land of Moons is also rarely open, which only makes the locals more curious about how its owner makes a living.\n\nThat said, it's clear the owner cares about their shop. A beautifully made sign hangs high above the door, and even though the shop is usually closed, its windows are always kept squeaky-clean. The door is firmly shut, but it's obviously received a fresh coat of paint.\n\n\"Still not open?\" A young bespectacled woman stands outside the shop, looking helplessly at the locked door. Undeterred, she squints through the glass windows, but doesn't see a soul inside.\n\nMost people would leave at this point, but this woman—glancing at the painstakingly wrapped gift in her hands and thinking of all those unread messages—isn't ready to give up yet. After hesitating several times, she makes her way to the bakery next door.\n\nAnxiously rubbing the gift wrapping, she asks the boy behind the counter: \"Excuse me, but do you know the owner of that bookshop? Her... name is Ygritte. I'm her editor... I haven't heard from her in a while, and I know she struggles with her health, so I thought I should come check on her.\" \n\n\n\n\"I think she might have moved away. Another girl runs the bookshop now, but we haven't spoken all that much...\"\n\n\"Ygritte? Oh, you mean the girl in the wheelchair? I didn't know she was a writer.\" \n\n\"Poor thing. It couldn't have been easy for her, being stuck in a wheelchair at such a young age. Now that you mention it, I heard she caught a lucky break and went somewhere to get treatment?\" \n\n\"Yeah, she left. I heard they used some special advanced treatment to heal her legs, so she left the store to a friend and went traveling around the world.\" \n\nShe visits several other local businesses and gets more or less the same information from each of them. Everyone remembers that cute little girl who always beamed with a smile from her wheelchair. But as for her current whereabouts, none are certain. The most anyone can say was that she seemed to have gotten treatment for her illness and then left. No one knows where or by whom she was treated. As for the new girl running the bookshop, all anyone knows is that she's a friend of Ygritte's.\n\nThe editor makes her way back, pondering what she's heard. \"She was cured, huh? I certainly hope so, that would be wonderful. I wonder if she's still going to send me her draft...\" \n\nStill unconsciously rubbing at the gift wrapping as she walks, she suddenly hears a tearing sound.\n\n\"Oh no! I ripped it...\" \n\nShe's nearly past the block now. The Land of Moons sign is so far behind her now that only its vague outline is visible.\n\n",

Successfully implemented the branch algorithm and biological community build. The branch world can also be run.\n\n2. Successfully migrated personnel and established two-way communications.\n\n3. Monitored the rapid distribution and cleansing program response of Gaea's computing power following personnel migration. Inferred to be due to the fact that external personnel all consist of Gaea's computing power, entering the isolated environment invariably draws Gaea's attention to the Data Plane Layer.\n\n4. According to the combat logs, cleansing programs will either manifest in the Data Plane Layer in physical form or conduct removal via standard methods.\n\n5. When the Data Plane Layer is purged, so too are any personnel within it.\n\nBased on these findings, the Director noted that poor personal equipment functionality was the main cause of personnel loss. The team must begin efforts to rethink and improve the personal equipment at once to enable personnel to return to the Axis World even when out of communication. Additionally, with regard to the Gaea responses caused by personnel migration, a signal blocking component must also be developed.\n\nThe team has already dubbed the purge program \"Realm Cleanser.\" According to the combat log, it is destructible and will halt interference in the Data Plane Layer upon its destruction. As such, we must assess whether Divine Power operates normally within the branch program so that Modifiers can later be deployed to combat the Realm Cleansers.\n\n...\n\n\n\nImprovement Plan\n\nAs instructed by the Director, we hereby propose the following improvement plan. It aims to improve mission execution standards, increase security and efficiency, and make preparations for formal operations.\n\n1. Analyze the Realm Cleanser combat data and create a targeted tactical design.\n\n2. Improve personal equipment and add personal signal blocking and emergency return functionalities.\n\n3. Prepare samples to assess the in-branch application of Divine Power.\n\n4. Compile a Hyperspace safety manual and administer training to all personnel involved with the project.\n\n5.

She then hears the door open softly, and turns to see Gloria and a medical AGI Mecha enter.\n\n\"Another checkup, Doctor Gloria?\" \n\nGloria walks up behind Tarina and places her arms around the girl's shoulders, looking to where Tarina was just staring. \"Just a routine checkup. What were you looking at so intently just now?\" \n\nTarina clutches Gloria's hands—Glora's body temperature is always just right. Tarina turns back to the courtyard. \"I was just wondering whether I could count all the fallen osmanthus flowers in the courtyard.\" \n\nGloria looks down at the serious Tarina with a chuckle and rests her chin on the girl's head. \"Count the flowers? That would be quite difficult, I'm afraid.

She can count the flowers with me!\" \n\nAt the same time, the AGI Mecha in the medical center's kitchen springs into action to prepare snacks for their guest.\n\nThe enormous medical center is almost completely empty, but every corner is kept in methodical and perfect working order.\n\n",

The same rules for Divine Power apply within the branch, but its use triggers Gaea's monitoring response. Cause inferred to be the invocation of Gaea's computing power by Divine Power. Targeted development of a shielding system required.\n\n2. Eliminating Realm Cleansers enhances branch stability and extends maintenance time.\n\n3. Damage to the Data Plane Layer is mapped to the Surface Layer. Branch stability is key to Surface Layer protection.\n\n4. Interfering with the branch increases the world's deviation rate and triggers Gaea's monitoring response. Information must be strictly controlled to limit interference to essential operations.\n\n5. The emergency return device has been proven effective, guaranteeing safety during the experiment. However, we have been unable to successfully transport physical matter from within the branch, as it is eliminated in the process.\n\nBased on the above conclusions, the Director noted that the branch is now ready to support the secure migration of personnel and we are in position to carry out our mission.

The mission will be carried out by an ops team in the branch with the support of the rest of the technical staff.\n\nAs there are a limited number of operatives this time, please contact the in-branch CORG organization after entering the Hyperspace. In accordance with Appendix 19 of the Articles of Association, charge is taken of all available personnel and facilities, and the \"Hyperspace Operating Procedures\" are to be distributed to all personnel in cooperation with the launch of operations.\n\nAccording to the R&D Center's analysis, data features identical to the origin of the Visbanes were detected in the data of this branch. The ops team's primary objective is to find leads relevant to the origin of the Visbanes, collect data, and advance our knowledge on the matter.\n\nAdditionally, unexplained space rifts were documented in Molander City's Nordburg at this time. The ops team must set up observation equipment at these rifts and promptly transfer the data back to the R&D Center for analysis.\n\nFurthermore, surveys must be conducted of the sites marked in subsections II–IV of the appendix file. Relevant objectives and orders of priority have been assigned to each individual, please confirm them at your earliest convenience. This mission is strictly confidential and relevant details are not to be shared between personnel.\n\nLastly, no return time has been set for this experiment. The ops team and technical staff are to maintain the Hyperspace for as long as possible while defending the Data Plane Layer from Realm Cleansers attacks.\n\nTechnical staff will conduct data reinforcement in the \"Land of Moons\" book store in Molander City. As the operations safehouse and regular return point, relevant information is listed in the appendix file for review at your earliest convenience.\n\nWe hope for your full cooperation and wish you the best of luck.\n\n\n\nImportant Notes\n\n1. Operations must be prioritized according to the stated objectives, and the order of individual operations must be confirmed prior to departure.\n\n2. Memorize the training content, and carry out missions in strict compliance with the safety handbook and operating procedures.\n\n3. Any information pertaining to the experiment is strictly confidential and must not be disclosed to unrelated persons under any circumstances.\n\n",

Even the stars aren't particularly bright tonight.\n\nThoth stands up and stretches, turns off the desk lamp, then heads down the stairs to the training room.\n\nVer is curled up on the floor surrounded by a pile of AGI Mechas, seemingly asleep, but her eyelashes are fluttering restlessly and there are freshly dried tears at the corners of her eyes.\n\nWithout making a sound, Thoth walks over, first smoothing out Ver's furrowed brows, then lifting her onto her back and carrying her back to her room.\n\nShe gently lays Ver down on her bed and tucks her in. Once she's certain that Ver is sound asleep, Thoth gets up to leave, but after taking just two steps, she suddenly seems to remember something. She turns back and silences Ver's alarm.\n\n\"Honestly, how am I supposed to report back with you in this state?\" \n\n\n\nMoments later, Thoth is on the roof of Land of Moons. She finds a comfortable seated position, then quietly looks up at the sky.\n\nBefore long, another figure floats up from downstairs. The figure appears to belong to a willowy girl, the hems of her dress fluttering gently in the evening breeze as she ascends.\n\nHolding something in her hand, she approaches Thoth and takes off her hood, revealing a face that's identical to hers.\n\n\"What's that you have there? Wine? What's up with this Hyperspace? You'd think that if I enjoyed that sort of thing ten years ago, I'd be the first to know.\" \n\n\"And here I thought that ten more years under CORG would only make me like it more. I wasn't expecting my life to still be so dull ten years from now.\" \n\nThey sit side by side, not looking at each other, but rather at the distant shapes of the city. Strands of their hair dance in the breeze, a few getting tangled together for a brief moment before quickly separating again.\n\n\"It'll all be ending soon.\" \n\n\"I'm aware.\" \n\n\"Anything you'd like to ask me? I do come from the future.\" \n\n\"I'm good. Just go back and keep doing what needs to be done.\" \n\n\n\nThe night sky looks as real as ever, with endless streams of wispy clouds threading out under the deep darkness. Nothing shows a single sign of the imminent collapse. Or maybe the blackness of this night itself is a sweeping blanket of black snow, dissipating the moment it falls to the earth.\n\n\"Well, you came all the way here. A small drink wouldn't hurt.\" \n\nTheir cups clink together, echoing long and clear over the rooftop.\n\n",

        "desc": "\n\nA crowd of protesters gather before the CORG building.\n\nBanners and signs rise up from the crowd, as well as photos held by people with tears in their eyes.\n\nAnger, suspicion, anxiety, hurt—a medley of emotions fester among the crowd. Like flames in a parched forest, they burn hotter and hotter, threatening to engulf the building in front of them.\n\nBut the building is silent, and no one emerges from it to face the gathered crowd. The only ones to greet them are heavily armed soldiers, stationed there to halt their advance. All that hangs on the bulletin board is a missing persons list, glaring brightly like a cold and hollow face.\n\n\n\nThis all started when CORG announced to the public that the cordon around Nordburg was officially being removed.\n\nThe draconian blockade order displaced countless people and families, and CORG's best efforts to make arrangements for them simply weren't up to the task for a population of this size. And the citizens' barrage of complaints and rumors about the blockade hasn't ceased yet.\n\nCORG repeatedly cautioned residents to stay away from Nordburg for the time being, but for those who longed for their former homes and livelihoods, these warnings fell on deaf ears as people continued to return anyway.\n\nThen came the disappearances. One by one, those who went to Nordburg disappeared in their familiar dwellings, never to return. CORG responded with a cursory tally of names, an account of the disappearances, and then silence. This cold indifference baffled people.\n\nSuch a response was never going to be satisfactory to the public. Countless rumors began to circulate in the streets, and the bizarre events of the last few days prompted a surge of anxiety and uneasiness to rush through the populace.\n\nThe bereaved and the beleaguered needed an outlet for their feelings, and CORG naturally bore the brunt of it. And so, day after day, they gather before CORG, their numbers slowly increasing and their voices gradually growing louder. Every day, people are carried from the rally to the hospital after crying themselves to collapse.\n\nBut CORG seems determined to remain silent from atop their fortress, leaving the sensation below to reach a fever pitch.\n\n\n\nNordburg, former blockade zone.\n\nWith another Realm Cleanser reduced to smoke, Thoth recalls her flying blades. She walks over to where it once stood and picks up a button from the ground.\n\nThough its owner is no more, it gleams vivaciously in the sunlight.\n\nThis is what's happening in Nordburg right now, and it will soon spread to all of Molander.\n\nAn agent's voice snaps Thoth out of her thoughts. \"Captain Thoth, we've cleared the area. There were three civilian casualties.\" \n\nThoth returns the button to where it was on the ground. \"Roger that. Report back and have them draft a statement.\" \n\nThe agent hesitates for a moment. \"Are you sure? With all these disappearances, public sentiment is getting out of control as it is.\" \n\nThoth shakes her head, then looks up at the sky. \"There's nothing else we can do. What's done is done.\" \n\n",

        "desc": "\n\nThoth has lost count of how many of these monsters she's dealt with so far.\n\nFlying daggers on countless threads dance across the battlefield, cutting one Realm Cleanser after another to pieces. Practically all they've heard these last few days is gunfire and the sounds of struggle.\n\nThe second sun hanging above seems to grow more visible with each passing day, looking like it will gobble up the first any moment now.\n\nEverything being done now seems futile considering what's to come. But as if by physical instinct or some sort of tacit understanding, they all continue the fight as if doing so will change everything.\n\nBernini rolls over the ground, whips around, and fires a shot clean through the Cleanser moments before it can harm her. Before she can get back up, a ghostly thread flies past her cheek. Then comes the sound of something shattering behind her. Bernini looks back to see a Cleanser, just shattered by the flying dagger, that had circled around behind her without her even realizing it.\n\nThoth runs over to Bernini and helps her to her feet.\n\nPanting slightly, Bernini says: \"Sorry, Captain. I guess I'm a little out of it.\" \n\nThoth retracts her threads and pats Bernini's shoulder. \"It's not just you. These battles have been pushing all of us to our limits. We're almost there. Once we take care of this batch...\"\n\nJust then, an alert sounds on Thoth's watch. She stops and looks down at the map. \"Projected landing site is the high street. Bernini, you and—Hold on, what's Ver doing over there?!\" \n\n\n\nEnding the call and looking over at the concerned Bernini, Thoth gives a wave of her hand. \"It's fine, Ver will take care of it. We can handle things here.\" \n\nBernini nods, then quickly re-enters the fray.\n\nJust then, Thoth's voice resonates clearly from the team's comms channel. \"Realm Controllers are incoming and Hyperspace collapse is imminent. This mission will end today. All personnel are to withdraw from the Hyperspace before the end of the day. Thank you all for your hard work on this mission.\" \n\nThe clamorous combat channel falls silent for a while. Finally, someone responds with \"Roger that.\" \n\nThoth isn't sure if she's imagining it, but after giving the command, the squad members' attacks seem even fiercer.\n\n",

        "desc": "\n\nThe buildings have collapsed and the streets have been reduced to gravel and dirt. The Realm Cleansers continue to wreak havoc all over the place and people can faintly be heard wailing somewhere.\n\nIgnoring all of this, Lokken walks steadily through this scene to the public square, like an ordinary civilian going out to enjoy a beautiful day.\n\nMaking her way to the plaza, she casually looks around, then leaps onto a towering statue.\n\nThe statue probably once depicted a goddess of some sort, but part of its upper half is now gone, having been removed in a clean slice. The sword once held high in the statue's hand has long since fallen to the ground in pieces.\n\nEven when armed with false blades, fragile and crumbling statues can't defend anything, themselves included.\n\nLeaping atop the statue, Lokken nonchalantly pats at the stubborn dust and makes herself comfortable on that clean cut. She fishes out her gaming device, puts on her headphones, and opens up the game's interface.\n\n\"Good thing this game can be played offline, or these last couple days would've bored me to death.\" As she talks to herself, a nearby building suddenly collapses out of nowhere, disintegrating into data fragments and disappearing on the spot without dropping even so much as a brick. Something must have happened on the Plane Layer.\n\n\"Say your prayers!\" On the screen, the boss' health bar is incrementally depleting. It's not clear if she's talking about the game or something else.\n\n\n\n\"Help! Help, someone, please!\" Lokken hears an elderly, hoarse cry through her headphones.\n\n\"None of it's real...\" Frowning, Lokken turns up the volume and tries to return her focus to the boss fight in the game.\n\nBut the person shouting clearly isn't giving up. Faint, intermittent words and phrases cut through the game's assorted sound effects and into Lokken's ears.\n\n\"Help...!\" The cries for help come to an abrupt stop as the outlandish monster—unbelievably terrifying only moments before—is obliterated in a plummeting flash of green and red light. The light disperses, and a red-haired girl slowly rises to her feet.\n\nShe turns away and gently twists her neck. \"Hey, gramps. You'd better back up.\" \n\n\n\nHaving wiped out all the surrounding Realm Cleansers, Lokken takes two leaps back to the old man, who's half sprawled on the ground in terror. She clicks her tongue, then extends a hand toward him.\n\nBewildered, the old man finally realizes that she intends to help him up. He hurriedly grabs hold of her hand and rises to his feet. \"Thank you so much! If it weren't for you, I'd be—\"\n\nLokken impatiently interrupts him. \"Don't thank me. I was just bored and happened to be passing by.\" \n\nThe old man shakes his head. \"In any case, you saved my life. Are you from CORG? When I get back, I'll send you a hero's banner.\" \n\nNow it's Lokken's turn to be bewildered. After a while, she finally turns her head away. \"Me? I'm no...\"\n\n\"Huh? Hey, gramps! Where are you going?!\" \n\n",
