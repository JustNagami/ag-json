I thought about what happened after we met at Tian Lu Traders, and what you didn't tell me about your health that day. It's been weighing on my mind, both as a doctor and as a friend.

Once linked with a vital signs monitoring bracelet, the bucket can adjust the temperature within in real-time, ensuring each bite you take of the fruit remains refreshingly cool without overly stimulating the digestive system...\nAnd then there's this \"Just-One-More-Episode\" Portable Projector, a custom order from a soap opera-loving elderly woman. You know, watching TV for too long can strain your eyes, right? But sometimes, she just can't stand the suspense! So, I designed this projector, which downloads and decodes upcoming episodes while you're watching the current one. When your eyes start to feel tired, it generates a simulation signal to stimulate the visual cortex in your brain, letting you \"watch\" without actually watching... Of course, I've put strict controls on the extension period to keep it within reasonable limits.\nWould you be interested in coming over to take these devices for a test run today?

So, I'd like to invite you to join me here in Omorfies as I work on my sculpture of the year.\nTime flows like water. As my carving knife slides across the plaster, what was previously elusive takes tangible form; no matter how much time has passed, there're always certain moments I want to retain forever.\nEspecially since... you've been in many of them this year.\n",

It all feels very different from the rest of the year! If you're free, you should come to Xu Heng to check it out. Just let me know when you're coming, and I will take some time off to accompany you. It's also been very busy at the Quad, but everyone was kind enough to celebrate my Arrival Day. Today, I received many good wishes, followed by questions about what the celebration would be like. It sounds a little odd, but this really got me in the mood, and I quite liked it, actually.\nWhenever I talk about Arrival Day, I feel rather distant from it, and I don't know how to respond to everyone's good wishes. They often say that this is a day worth celebrating, for this marks the continuation of life and bears testimony to growth over the year just past. What I remember most clearly, however, is the first time, the real \"Arrival Day,\" which was also the day when catastrophe had struck Gaea. If the world had never needed me, maybe it would be worthy of everyone's celebration... Only on Arrival Day would I feel so sorry.\nWe came into this world with the responsibility of protecting life, and all we've to show for it after all these years is this unfinished business. Fortunately, there's always someone by my side, helping me do the things I can't do and understand the true meaning of perseverance. I hope that someday in the future, both Gaea and we can usher in a new life and the true continuation and growth of civilization.\nI wish you lasting peace and contentment.",

I think you should definitely take some herbs. Since you're busy at work, I've taken the liberty of putting together a decoction for you, which should arrive with this note. All you have to do is to boil it in water and take one dose a day. Of course, I've tweaked the formula so it shouldn't be too bitter this time. Having said that, while this formula can improve your bodily functions, if you continue to experience issues, you should seek medical treatment as soon as possible.\nMmm... How about this. If you have some free time, Admin, give me some advance notice and I'll head over to Ain Soph to help you. Given the specifics of your condition, I think it's best that I come myself. Besides, I'm already familiar with your health... Since you're doing crucial work, low mood and overwork may be unavoidable. Even so, I hope you'll be able to take care of yourself.

Very practical if you want to open a restaurant!\nAnother was a kind of frame you can put fishing rods on and it alerts you if any of them catch a fish, so you can have a dozen or more rods working at once. But I don't know anyone who goes fishing, so it was never used.\nOh, and another was a bed-car? Or a car-bed? Anyway, it is a bed with wheels, and you can steer it in any direction you want. It can turn on the spot, even. You can go off-road racing in it!\nAnyway, I found lots of things like those.

If it weren't for your message, I would have forgotten that today is my Arrival Day.\nGiven your status, the fact that you remembered such a small detail earns my respect.\nAs for living conditions, I've never really cared much about them. I'd rather focus my energy on missions. While you might have mentioned it out of politeness, not everyone cares about someone considered a nominally dangerous person, so I appreciate it.\nI now have a clear goal with group of like-minded people. Although all things are far from pleasant, I know I'm doing the right thing.\nI'm on the front lines almost every day, so I haven't had time to prepare a proper gift. I'm sending you my trusty combat knife instead; it's been very useful in the field.\nIf you're not interested in using it for fighting, it's also great for slicing smoked meat.\nThere's nothing more to say. I hope we both... go forward smoothly.",
