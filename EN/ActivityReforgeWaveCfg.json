        "description": "Aether Gazer's Modifiers have managed to stop the Visbane offense by themselves, and all Visbanes on the Surface Layer have been eliminated.\n\nAt the same time, the Cryptics from Aether Gazer have also identified a weakness in the elite AGI Mechas' shield system: the shield can be whittled down to zero with Light attacks.\n\nDeploy a squad to eliminate the elite AGI Mechas and destroy the target facility. Corrupted humans will also fight alongside the AGI Mechas during the battle, and overall, the enemy is of <color=#FFAC4F>extremely high combat power</color>, so proceed with caution.\n\n- Enemy type: <color=#CD6269>Humans</color>, <color=#CD6269>elite AGI Mechas</color>, and <color=#CD6269>smaller AGI Mechas</color>.\n- Enemy elite AGI Mechas are immune to damage although this effect disappears after they have been hit 90 times by <color=#CD6269>Light attacks</color>.\n- All friendly units <color=#C5F448>recover a certain amount of HP</color> every 10s.",
