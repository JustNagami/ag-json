Bathed in light, quenched by water, and watched over by the winds, it nurtured eleven new lives.\nThese Star Children were called \"humans.\"\nHumans, who received Origin's grace, gradually came to possess intelligence.\nThis intelligence, which granted humans the ability to walk and talk, set them apart from all else.\nOrigin then gave them \"the Clock of Aurelia,\" bringing day and night to their world.\nAt this time, there were no fields, no flowering or fruiting trees, nor had water ever flowed before.\nGuided by the Clock, however, humans labored and toiled until finally, other life began to burgeon.\nThe Star Children revered Origin as their supreme mother and regarded the Clock she bestowed on them as a sacred object high above.\nThey venerated it unprompted, establishing their own simple pledges. Thus, a contract was formed that joined the humans together.\nThe Star Children rose at sunrise and worked until sunset, then at night would sing hymns together for the Clock and Origin.\nThese eleven humans enjoyed the most wonderful things their world had to offer and they loved each other deeply, so the gates of Paradise were opened to them.\nThere they found inexhaustible food and everlasting artifacts, they no longer needed to fear aging, sickness, or death, and their every wish was answered.\nThey could have lived forever and free from worry in this paradise, but they had not discovered that a demon was already in their midst."

From birth, it was destined for a lonely and tragic existence.\nIn the beginning, it only took seeing the Star Children living plentiful lives for the sin of covetousness to dawn in its heart. It infiltrated their paradise and wantonly ate and drank its fill without giving anything in return.\nThen when it saw how the eleven loved each other, the sin of envy arose as it wished that they could experience its own loneliness.\nThus, the demon found one of the eleven and said to him:\n\"I am an envoy of the Clock, and the Clock has chosen you\u2014everything in this paradise now belongs to you, and none other than you shall acquire sustenance from it.\"\nBelieving the demon's words, he locked the gates of Paradise the following day, claiming everything within it for himself alone.\nHe no longer needed to toil, yet the bounties he received increased, turning him proud until he believed himself to be King of Paradise.\nThe demon then found another, and said to him:\n\"Paradise ought to be yours, but it has been taken up by someone else. You should lead the others to reclaim it.\"\nBelieving the demon, he gathered the others to denounce the \"king,\" but the \"king\" was unwilling to share any of the prosperity he enjoyed in Paradise.\nThus the Star Children raised arms against one of their own for the first time and became tainted with the sin of wrath.\nParadise was recovered, but the seed of calamity had already been sowed. They became indolent and passed their days in delusion.\nWithout even realizing it, they went from being votaries of the Clock to sinners who coveted its sanctity.\nSeeing that the time was ripe, the demon announced to the remaining ten:\n\"Whoever can seize the Clock of Aurelia shall become the Master of Paradise for all eternity.\"\nThe Star Children fell apart and they forgot their vows to support each other\u2014all they had left to offer to the Clock now was blood and smoke.\nTheir battle intensified until one day, even the Clock too was shattered. With day and night turned upside down, Origin was enraged.\nLeaving no room for regret for the Star Children, Origin retracted its grace.\nThis faulty world was destroyed, and a new one was born.\nHumans were created once again, but laden with the shackles of sin and doomed to forever chase Paradise with no hope of entering it.\nThe Clock was reshaped into an hourglass and hidden in the singularity of the universe, where it counted down to humanity's atonement."

Origin exhorted the youth to remember this promise, then disappeared.\nAt first, the youth really did honor his promise and used the knowledge to craft tools and free people from some of their fetters.\nBut as the youth grew older, he became convinced that this knowledge should remain in the world for all time.\nSo, he assembled some helpers and decided to build a stone tree called \"Topology,\" engraving all of the knowledge he had acquired onto its surface.\nAs more and more words were recorded, the tree continued to grow in height until Origin returned and beheld this tree that reached the sky.\nKnowing that the youth had broken his promise, Origin rained down punishment: Lightning plummeted from the sky and struck the tree, destroying it and scattering the stone pieces containing the knowledge in all directions.\nThe tree Topology was no more."
