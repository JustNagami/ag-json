Shifted Stars and Shifting Flowers can be redeemed for Special VIP Invites. <color=#F6841D>When purchasing Special VIP Invites using Shifting Flowers, discounts will be applied based on the current number of purchase</color>.\n2. Each invitation grants a chance of obtaining different type of rewards: <color=#F6841D>1%</color> for Core Rewards and <color=#F6841D>99%</color> for Other Rewards. Each invitation grants a reward. One Core Reward is guaranteed within every <color=#F6841D>10</color> invitations. <color=#F6841D>Once a reward is drawn, it cannot be drawn again</color>. All rewards in the pool will be drawn within <color=#F6841D>80</color> invitations.\n3. When purchasing Special VIP Invites using Shifted Stars, they cost Shifted Star ×120 each. Up to 80 Invites may be purchased.\n4. When purchasing Special VIP Invites using Shifting Flowers, they cost Shifting Flower ×120 each. The discounts are as follows: 20 Invites at 90% off (Shifting Flower ×12 each), 10 Invites at 80% off (Shifting Flower ×24 each), 10 Invites at 70% off (Shifting Flower ×36 each), 10 Invites at 60% off (Shifting Flower ×48 each), 10 Invites at 40% off (Shifting Flower ×72 each), 10 Invites at 20% off (Shifting Flower ×96 each), and 10 Invites at full price. Up to 80 Invites may be purchased in total.\n\nIII. Core Reward Probability:\n\n1. When a Core Reward is drawn, the initial probability of it being each Core Reward is as follows:\n\nWhispering Waves: 0.30%\nFrosted Branch: 30.00%\nPrecise Scan Voucher ×10: 2.70%\nFunctor Scan Voucher ×5: 10.00%\nTranscendence Crystal ×10: 12.00%\nSpirit Extract T4 ×96: 20.00%\nSigil Module T3 ×40: 25.00%\n\n2. When a Core Reward is drawn, the probability of it being each reward in the Core Reward Pool will be adjusted in real time based on their corresponding weights.
