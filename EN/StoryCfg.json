To get her hands on the giant plushie prize, she decided to sign up for the competition with a proposal based on the famous Xu Heng holiday, New Year's Awakening. However, she was at a loss as to how she would actually present the unique Cloudsong Ore technology of Xu Heng in it.\nMi-Nian and Jinwu, who would run into each other at Aether Gazer from time to time, got on like a house on fire and started working together to study Xu Heng cuisine and design the theme event.\nAfter some back and forth, the new dish was finally approved by the Ain Soph Culinary Arts Association.
