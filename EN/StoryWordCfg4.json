This friend was a skilled swordsman, the one who was most likely to come first place. But he preferred to be idle and was not interested in that.\n\nKagutsuchi: Everyone in that dojo looked at the others as mortal enemies. But this skilled swordsman took the useless person to the rooftop to see the fireworks instead.\n\nKagutsuchi: The useless one had never seen anything so bright and beautiful. Seeing his excitement, his friend asked him if he wanted to go someplace nearby to see the biggest fireworks yet.\n\nKagutsuchi: But at the end of the story, and before the following year's fireworks show began, the two never saw each other again.",
