She thought she'd seen it all, and found human civilization tedious in the extreme.\nThe only thing that held any interest for her, in that it allowed her to escape humdrum reality, was alcohol. There was a short time where it was rare to see her without a bottle or glass in her hand.\nHowever, one day, Sekhmet was assigned to offer support for an impending Quake, but she was drunk as usual. It wasn't until the 29th call  came that she finally woke up with a start and realized the day was almost over. Opening the drapes, she saw thick smoke hanging over a city in the distance.\nWracked with guilt, she made her way to the site of the Quake as quickly as possible. She knew she'd messed up, but she also thought she'd have a chance to make things right.\nHowever, by the time she arrived, the Quake was long over and the Visbanes had been defeated. But it was at a heavy cost\u2014over one hundred operatives and civilians had lost their lives.\nSekhmet spent a long time running around, but couldn't find anywhere at the disaster relief site that needed her. She suddenly realized that, as a Mod, she wasn't a \"necessity\" for humanity's survival, but rather a \"result\" of it.\nShe was a suit of armor that humanity had refined after suffering through countless disasters.\nBut, even without this armor, civilization was still able to survive bloodshed.\nSince the Quake was successfully defended against, and given Sekhmet's past performance, her superiors decided not to punish her too severely.\nBut that was the last time Sekhmet missed a day of work, and the last time any of her colleagues smelled alcohol on her breath. From that day forth, Sekhmet vowed she would never touch a drop of alcohol again.\n",

However, very few people know the reason behind this and, given her wild personality, even fewer are brave enough to ask.\nConversely, Sekhmet loves drinking tea and even has a dedicated corner in her office for tea ceremonies. She is almost always on the go, so making a cup of tea is her equivalent of entering power-saving mode.\nCatching a moment of calm before returning to the madness\u2014this is her true happy place.",

Every criminal Sekhmet has ever interrogated has ended up admitting their crimes, even ones they're not currently under investigation for.\nHow does she do it? Video footage shows that she has never once resorted to violence. In fact, she hardly even moves.\nThe cameras in the interrogation room usually pick up audio too, except when Sekhmet is there; a well-meaning engineer has made sure of that.\n\"It was necessary to preserve everyone's mental state... I don't want anyone other than the criminals to be driven insane.\"\nPeople have only ever heard her say two sentences:\n\"Don't be frightened, I'll think of a way to defend you.\" This is Sekhmet's opener in the interrogation room.\n\"I'm afraid I won't be able to help you.\" This is her closing remark, accompanied by a pitying expression.\n",

She could instantly tell that Bastet had just been interviewed, and of course Bastet recognized CORG's top investigator.\nSekhmet suddenly had a brilliant idea\u2014wouldn't it be an interesting experiment to have someone brand new working under her, someone she could train and mold herself?\nPeople were shocked to discover that Bastet had been posted to Sekhmet's team for her very first job in CORG, and this new upstart was carefully scrutinized by the others for weeks.\nHowever, upon meeting her and seeing her cheery disposition, their doubts began to fade.\nAs for Anubis, Sekhmet has always believed that it's much easier to have operatives who can work alone, but it still took her a long time to persuade him to accept Bastet as his new partner.",

It doesn't take long for her to read someone, which is why colleagues who are lying or who have something to hide usually give her a wide berth.\nTo use her own words, she doesn't hate lies because there is always at least a grain of truth in them. In her eyes, every lie is a transparent piece of paper.\nHowever, that's not to say that it's ever a good idea to lie to her, because she has enough particular hobby: She enjoys hypnotizing liars into revealing the very truths they are trying to hide away.\nWhat's worse is that the liars don't even remember they've been hypnotized, so they're very confused as to why they have to hide in the dark from the judgmental looks of her friends.\nHonesty really is the best policy if you ever find yourself chatting to Sekhmet.",

However, a giant swarm of Visbanes appeared and killed all of the hostages before attacking Luwu.\nJust when she thought it was all over, Baize appeared and saved her, but was injured in the process. This is the event that triggered the awakening of Luwu's Modifier consciousness.\nAfterwards, Luwu understood that Baize issued the order to protect her from the Visbane assault, but she was unable to understand she needed to stay alive more than she needed to complete the rescue.\nAs a police officer, Luwu always saw herself as a protector of the innocent, regardless of the cost to herself. Baize, as a CORG agent, instead believed that, since police officers are humans too, they also needed to be protected and should not expose themselves to unnecessary risk.\n\"What you call justice is just a swinging scale. Whether something is \"just\" or not depends entirely on where the pendulum is in your heart. And that's the imaginary standard you'd prefer to use instead the clearly defined and approved rules?\"\n\"...I can't just sit back and let people die.\"\nThe two women couldn't come to an agreement, and Baize had no choice but to report the incident to her superiors.

Sure enough, the latest Round Robin plushies could be found on her desk the very same day they were released.\nHowever, if you were to ask Luwu what the fascination with plushies is, she would scratch her head and be unable to give a clear answer.

However, Luliang knows they mostly want to be paired with Luwu because she'll do everything for them, so to prevent them from becoming lazy and complacent, she often assigns Luwu to solo missions.\nShe may work alone, but whenever she's not on a mission Luwu is always surrounded by friends.\nThanks to her willingness to help others and her sunny disposition, Luwu has made lots of new friends in Tian Lu Traders. She likes to look after everyone, and is highly regarded and well-liked throughout the building.\nRecently, Luwu has been posted long-term to Shashvat, and only returns to Tian Lu Traders infrequently. Despite the absence, she is still warmly welcomed back whenever she is spotted in Laixian Hall.\nYingzhao is something of a workaholic, but even she is willing to stop and prepare a feast for Luwu with Linyu. Other members of the security team will invite Luwu to try vintage wines from their cellar, or to a friendly sparring match in the dojo.\nThe only time Luwu feels a pang of regret is when she's spent a short time back in HQ and has to go back in the field.",

She always knows what needs to be done, be that in the lab or on an assignment from Gengchen.\nOnly she knows the truth\u2014that she's weak and vulnerable. She follows Gengchen around like a lost puppy. She understands the duty Gaea gave her as a Modifier, but she's unable to carry it out. She's not as strong as the other Mods, and was born blind in one eye. Even her Access Key is incomplete.\nShe doesn't know her purpose and believes that her existence is proof that something went seriously wrong with Gaea.\n\"Do I really have what it takes to be a Modifier?\"\nWhen she's alone, Zhiming is wracked by self-doubt. She goes to great effort to acquire new knowledge as another way to prove herself. With her intelligence and hard work, Zhiming finds fame as one of Xu Heng's top scholars in a few short years, but she still hasn't found the answer to her most fundamental question of all. The years of bottling up her emotions have made her increasingly taciturn, and her personality becomes more intense. She begins to push people away, as she sees their love and affection as silent mockery and pity.\nThis situation continues until she experiences something of a connection to Ethereal Enigma. Gengchen, sensing a Divine Power fluctuation, rushes to the lab and sees Zhiming, standing there in a daze with an unsettling smile on her face. After that, Zhiming locks herself away in the lab, working feverishly on restoring the Access Key. After several sleepless nights, Zhiming emerges from her \"retreat\" even weaker than before, but now with purpose in her eyes.\n\"Maybe we are all the same, after all.\"",

Even though most people these days are accustomed to reading books on their terminals, Zhiming likes to do things the old-fashioned way.\nYears ago, before she awakened, Zhiming spent a lot of time looking up information to try and find out why Gaea generated with the wrong parameters. Once she had awakened, she realized that everything that had happened to her could not be explained by the books. But during those years, she read through a mountain of old books and got used to reading every day, so even when she no longer had a reason to read, she found it relaxing to do so for pleasure and decided to keep it up.\nZhiming's collection of books is enormous, and it spans every topic from \"Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica\" to \"Post-Farrowing Sow Care.\" She can be incredibly curious about some very strange books, but whenever she buys them, she gets worried people will mock her for her odd hobby and pretends they were gifted to her instead.\nWhenever she has a lot on her plate and is starting to feel overwhelmed, Zhiming will look for inspiration and peace in her books.

This meant people were willing to overlook her wild appearance, as there were benefits to getting close to her, like acquiring a much-coveted patent she had or reaching Gengchen.\nHowever, due to some things that had happened to Zhiming in childhood, these small-minded people made the already-taciturn scientist even less willing to open herself up to others.\nThere are many important matters in the Quad that need to be decided, but of the agents who remain there, Lingguang is too soft, Jianbing is too impulsive,) and Mengzhang is never there. This leaves Zhiming as the best person to make these decisions, given her status, personality, and abilities.\nBut Zhiming does not enjoy this responsibility, and she especially doesn't like having to liaise with that many people. The constant treachery in politics tires her, but she is the one best suited to it. So, to share some of the burden Gengchen has been handed from the Quad, Zhiming eventually accepts a position working in the diplomacy and clerk teams.",

She prefers her meals to be plain, so whenever she's on duty in Yu Jing, she will always ask the cafeteria chef to add only half as much salt as they usually do. The only other person with similar tastes is Lingguang, so if they're ever in Yu Jing together, Lingguang will cook an extra portion of food for her. Zhiming always protests and tells Lingguang not to go to so much trouble, but she always polishes off every last bite.\nThe first thing Zhiming learned about Gengchen was that she'd lost her sense of taste, but she couldn't believe it until she'd asked Lingguang. To make Gengchen not feel different from everyone else, Zhiming tells the cafeteria to always cook her the same thing they make for Gengchen. When Gengchen sees that Zhiming is eating the same thing as her, she wonders why Zhiming has suddenly started eating so little. It's not until she asks Lingguang in private that she finds out the truth.\nOnce she does, she immediately goes to Zhiming, who's retching by the pond. The two of them end up having the worst argument they've ever had since they met.\n\"I just wanted to share your burden! Does it make you feel better now that you've hurt me?\"\nZhiming cries, in a rare outburst of pent-up emotion. She starts to leave.\n\"I'm sorry. But you need to look after yourself\u2014because everyone's counting on you to keep the Astral Engine going...\"\nZhiming storms off without saying another word.\nThe next time Zhiming is in Yu Jing, it's as though nothing happened. The two of them sit and eat together as normal, chatting about their days.\nZhiming has never tried to put on a brave face since then.",

As a result, there are many people in Xu Heng who feel like Zhiming is their teacher.\nAlthough many people call her \"teacher,\" the only person she truly feels is her prot\u00e9g\u00e9e is Linyu.\nWhen Linyu was recommended to go study at the Quad, Zhiming refused to teach her. She didn't have the patience to have a student shadowing her every second of the day, so she requested Linyu be assigned to Lingguang instead. However, when Linyu went to the trouble of arranging a meeting with Zhiming, Zhiming began to waver. It was because of what she saw in Linyu's eyes: herself as a girl, someone tirelessly trying to prove herself, determined to shoulder the burdens of more important people. So Zhiming gave Linyu a chance, telling her, \"If you can answer all of these questions, I'll let you be my student.\"\nWhen Linyu returned her test paper, Zhiming found her answers to be naive and full of holes, but also surprisingly spiritual and creative.\nZhiming pointed out to Linyu one answer where her theory was completely wrong, and then brought her to the lab to explain why. After discovering that Linyu had fully learned and absorbed all of the new information, Zhiming granted her access to the laboratory and told her (much to her amazement) that Linyu should call Zhiming \"teacher\" from then on.",

Unfortunately, silence does nothing to lessen the gravity of Tsukuyomi's stress, nor affect her infinitely collected exterior.",

Knowing Verthandi's close friendship with their darling daughter in her final moments, Tarina's parents were delighted to formally adopt Verthandi from the orphanage. Thus began the next phase of Verthandi's life: happy normality.\nVerthandi never forget her covenant with Tarina and to this day is still devoted to the same zest for life modeled after her childhood friend.\n\"I was saved by people, raised by people and, even if I'm a Modifier, I don't see how I'm fundamentally different from anyone else\".\nVerthandi's Modifier powers came at the age of 17 when she immediately became aware of two key facts: the necessity of protecting human civilization and destroying Visbanes, soon after which she received her first invitation to join Aether Gazer. It was hard for Verthandi to even contemplate leaving her beloved adoptive parents. However, she still chose to leave, claiming she was to attend the university in Core City in Ain Soph, where the Aether Gazer HQ is located.",

In fact, Verthandi is one of those rare individuals always full of positive energy and ready with a kind word\u2014even at the beginning of her joining the Rookie Squad.\n\"I work hard 'cos I'm all about protecting the world and the people I love!\"\nYet Verthandi's tireless optimism, inner strength, and promotion of positive vibes have been learned attributes acquired from those important to her and now she also wants to share these good qualities with others\u2014as she tells it.",

A true carnivore, Verthandi is often heard exclaiming random comments such as \"Barbecue completes my life!\" and has embarked on a long process of visiting every single meat-focused restaurant in Ain Soph, including steakhouses so far Verthandi has had to call for help to get back home.

So Verthandi found herself quietly waiting for death in the inpatient ward.\nA girl named Tarina transferred in a week later, a few years older than Verthandi and just as ill, but starkly different in personality. Tarina had benefited from a normal, happy family life and parents desperate for anything that could save their beloved daughter. Tarina reflected their kindness in many ways, such as by avoiding negativity or comments to inspire worry in others. Indeed, her disposition was much sunnier than even many of the healthy people beyond the hospital walls to the point Verthandi wondered if she was even really ill\u2014that is, until she saw one of Tarina's medical episodes. Tarina wailed as dark fungus-looking patches spread across her skin as if her body was disintegrating.\n\"You saw that...? I'm sorry... Did I frighten you?\"\nTarina could only manage a helpless, bitter smile as she wiped the cold beads of sweat from her forehead\u2014as if even this chilling scene had long become commonplace.\nSix precious months with Tarina became the most wonderful time of Verthandi's life thus far. Verthandi's horizons expanded dramatically as she met people from outside the orphanage for the first time and came to realize the wonderful potential of other human beings. Without realizing it, Verthandi had been deeply changed by her friendship with the amazing Tarina and her worldview and indeed entire personality gradually shifted.",

The Cryptics can offer further insight:\nKuninotokotachi spent some time hunting down Visbanes during her pre-Aether Gazer days in Sasanami District, which at one point resulted in a severe injury because of carelessness. Tsukuyomi quickly intervened to bring Kuninotokotachi to Aether Gazer's medical team, who managed to save her life with great difficulty despite the near-fatal Visbane strike, and yet her recovery came at the cost of her left eye. The Cryptics, at Odin's urging, installed a bionic replacement composed out of precious core crystal. Thus began Kuninotokotachi's new hairstyle as a means of concealing an implant that ironically has greatly boosted her powers. Strictly speaking, the eye does not even need to be open to grant Kuninotokotachi vision of her surroundings.\nKuninotokotachi has been incredibly thankful to Tsukuyomi ever since, ultimately ensuring her acceptance of Odin's invitation to Aether Gazer and, naturally, Tsukuyomi's Pheasant Squad.",

Kuninotokotachi must imbibe a steady stream of medication to limit the Visbanian corruption and prevent a renewed outburst of the wound from consuming any more body tissue.\nIt may have been possible to formulate a dedicated antidote to the festering in Kuninotokotachi's body if the precise identity of the Visbane was known, but neither Kuninotokotachi nor Tsukuyomi got a clear look at its form. Eventually, more and more powerful medication will be needed to stem the corruption, and yet at the great cost of painful side-effects that have contributed to many sleepless nights on Kuninotokotachi's part. She is often forced to hide the medication infusion away from the eyes of her teammates to avoid causing them undue stress should they witness the pain she must endure on each occasion.

Indeed, all Kuninotokotachi can do is offer her help where able. Any attempts at light-hearted banter, or to engage Tsukuyomi in further discussion on the topic, cause Tsukuyomi to feel a little helpless, but in fact, it's the way Kuninotokotachi tries to make her happier.\nKuninotokotachi's attempts are definitely not appreciated by the Pheasant Squad's other member, who finds Kuninotokotachi's attempts to filter out something of Tsukuyomi's mysterious past immensely irritating. Buzenbo is cut from rather sterner cloth and disapproves of jocular conversation, a fact that has occasionally made their squad partnership somewhat difficult.\nAny attempt by Kuninotokotachi to turn the discussion to lighter notes is always met by a stern glare from Buzenbo's direction.\n\"Hey, look!

Vidar had let her guard down, giving the Visbanes the upper hand, at which point Leviathan deftly blocked their initial wave of attacks with her anchor. However, in haste to adjust the position of Leviathan was hit by this blow, wounded and fainted. Leviathan woke up to find herself lying, surprisingly, on Vidar's legs, overexcited she then fainted again, scaring Vidal into thinking she was seriously injured.\nVidar placed the injured Leviathan that night into a protective warmer, and fed the recovering girl a steady stream of barbequed morsels to help her strength recover.\n\"Oh... Master, Master! You really don't remember me?\" Leviathan didn't seem terribly phased by her injuries as gazed keenly at Vidar while wrapped up in a kind of sack.\n\"I don't remember you, sorry...\"\n\"Oh. Alright then.\"\n\"But there is something about you, Leviathan, that does calm me,\" Vidar said to herself quietly. \"You, Fenrir, and myself... we seem more like... family.\"\n\"Master, master!\"\nVidar stepped to one side to see Leviathan rushing over excitedly for a hug, which unfortunately ended up in missing Vidar for the snow.\n\"Are you alright?\"\n\"I-I'm fine! I'm actually happy!\" So Leviathan said with a smile as Vidar pulled her up.",

The sound of metal grinding against rock gradually ceased, whereupon Leviathan found herself somewhere in the middle of an artic glacier. As to how she had ended up on an escape pod in the first place, what it was doing falling on a glacier, and all the other assorted questions that might go along with that, had for some reason either been lost from, or perhaps was never present in, her memory. The only thing known about Leviathan is when she came to Aether Gazer, she did wear a strange white astronaut's outfit.\nLeviathan claims to remember spending long years in the polar region with Vidar, including bad times with cranky penguins and an ice breaker ship anchor weapon found in an ice cave she used for anti-penguin self-defense.\nFurthermore, Leviathan claims she wasn't as gifted a hunter as Vidar despite the new weapon, and that she likely would have experienced a cold and/or hungry death without Vidar's help around this time.",

Are you sure you don't have me mixed up with somebody else?\" and \"Who on earth are you, really?\" she nevertheless has come to terms with the idea that this strange Leviathan and her at times endearing mannerisms might actually have what it takes to become Vidar's closest friend.\nIt is for this reason that Odin decided to pair the two into the Winter Squad in light of the possibility that somehow Leviathan has the full and true account of those arctic years, in which Vidar serves as Leviathan's squad leader.\nApart from beating up Visbanes, the pair also have a tradition of, and special prerogative for, adventuring around the polar regions every year for months at a time. This not only provides a wealth of experience in dealing with inhospitable climates, but also uncovers potentially very dangerous Visbane activity under, for example, the ice sheets from time to time.

Nevertheless, Leviathan's many mistakes on mission place her far from the most experienced combat specialist at Aether Gazer, not to mention frequent bouts of youthful absent-mindedness.\nAs she often says sobbing, \"What should I do? I made a mistake on the mission today. Will Master be angry at me?\"\nLeviathan is quite prone to feeling the sky is about to fall, particularly in regard to her friendship with Vidar, but will usually bounce back quickly enough. For instance, Vidar will sometimes visit to check in with Leviathan and, if she is asleep, readjust the bedsheets Leviathan tends to kick away.\n\"Phew!

Many years of combat practice at Aether Gazer have elevated Buzenbo into one of its very strongest Modifiers and combat specialists. Even so, the decision by management to send Buzenbo back to Sasanami District on a particular mission was a cause of great concern, not least for Buzenbo. Her success proved once and for all that she has, in some serious and encouraging way, moved on from the shadows cast by her earlier life.\n\"The katana of the warrior is the reflection of her heart.\"\nBuzenbo is not mature enough to understand her adoptive father's meaning when he bid farewell to Buzenbo on that cold day in Sasanami. Buzenbo is convinced that she has now found a way that works uniquely well for her: to remain alongside her mentor Tsukuyomi and function as the organization's right-hand lady, or perhaps \"sharpened katana,\" against the Visbane menace.",

But under the influence of her parents, Buzenbo voluntarily embarked on this arduous path.\n\"She's just being influenced. No doubt Buzenbo will give it up once she realizes just how hard the way of kendo is.\"\nThe adoptive father who started to teach Buzenbo with this mentality was deeply impressed by Buzenbo's genuine interest and extraordinary talent after actually starting kendo training. In fact, Buzenbo exceeded her adoptive father's skill with the katana at just 14 and, fittingly enough, formally inherited the Kogarasu Maru katana of Hayashizaki Hall during the ceremony granting Menkyo Kaiden status to the young samurai.\n\"It is a symbol of my father's great trust in me, and I cannot let him down.\"\nBuzenbo has deeply internalized such sentiments, and her resulting journey to ever greater heights of skill with the katana has continued unabated.",

It took a very long succession of unbroken victories over the masters of Sasanami and surrounding regions to cement Buzenbo's reputation as perhaps the strongest samurai in Sasanami of her generation.\n\"Talent must recognize talent.\" The masters of Sasanami came to gradually recognize the reality of Buzenbo's place as the field's foremost practitioner.\nUnfortunately, many of those same people Buzenbo defeated simply saw her victory as a result of raw talent, ignoring the vast amount of training and effort involved.",

Noting the chaos of Buzenbo's past, Tsukuyomi has asked, \"If you could have your choice again, would you still destroy that Visbane?\" Buzenbo considered for a moment. \"If it were my father instead of me, he would have destroyed that thing without hesitation. I inherited his Kogarasu Maru. My choices must be worthy of his... and it.\"\nSuch is Buzenbo Tengu's strength of character and uncompromising ideals paired with much confusion about her direction in life and difficulties with belonging. Tsukuyomi has developed a strong sense of respect for Buzenbo and her choices, and has decided from hence onward to take a Buzenbo under her wings at Aether Gazer in the hopes of guiding her out of her \"psychological morass.\"\nSeveral years have passed since and Tsukuyomi really does seem to have taken on the role of an \"older sister,\" visible in the sheen in Buzenbo's eyes when discussing Tsukuyomi.

Yet Buzenbo's enemy was strangely powerful. Highly exposed, Buzenbo Tengu quickly found herself at the edge of death, at which point her Modifier awareness sprang to life. She was filled with an indescribable sense that something within her had changed for the stronger and that the hoodlum could not be allowed to live. Thus Buzenbo abandoned all caution and ran the hoodlum through with her katana in front of the police who just arrived, a fateful decision by which Buzenbo became known henceforth as a murderer.\nThe tale of \"killer Buzenbo of Sasanami\" became worse and scarier with each retelling and, soon enough, the police issued a warrant for Buzenbo's arrest. Buzenbo's adoptive father acted quickly to protect her from a lengthy prison sentence and preserve the dojo's fine reputation by formally expelling Buzenbo while arranging a secret plane flight to Ain Soph.\nAether Gazer quickly located the newly-awakened Modifier and used its prodigious connections to smooth over the gravity of the incident. Buzenbo was only too happy to receive the news that the so-called \"hoodlum\" she had slain was in fact Encroacher Type Visbane disguised as a human being, explaining Buzenbo's hostility and soothing her guilty conscience. Unfortunately, the rumor mill of Sasanami could not be influenced by such details, and Buzenbo sadly realized she had graduated to the status of an infamous murderer in her hometown. There was no going back to her adoptive father or Hayashizaki Hall. Buzenbo decided the best course of action may simply be to stay in Ain Soph and work with Aether Gazer.\nBuzenbo Tengu had originally wanted to return the Kogarasu Maru before leaving forever, but her adoptive father refused to take it back.\n\"The katana is one with its wielder; her concerns, and her faults.\"\nBuzenbo has often found herself reflecting on these parting words, which have worked to strengthen her resolve to develop into the most powerful combatant at Aether Gazer in any way she can.",

The Cryptics have also conjectured Ausar might have a different view of what constitutes true danger.\n(2) Osiris must use the \"Living Soul\" Access Key that triggers Ausar directly or enter an extremely Bane Energy-heavy environment.\n(3) Osiris finds herself at a mental or physical extreme; physical injury, sickness, psychological terror or extreme anger are all liable to conjure up the Ausar personality.",

As if fate had responded to Sobek's unspoken prayer, he fell down into a swamp whereupon his hand touched what sure seemed like the handles of two decent-sized blades. The turgid rain revealed the two blades that would follow Sobek forever after...\nOlheim has not quite brought himself to accept Sobek's continued use of these grungy-looking weapons despite their quasi-mythical origin story, but is willing to dispatch cleaning and maintenance assistance particularly considering the organization's recent shortages and to ensure Sobek the continual use of semi-decent weaponry.",

Over time, she has come to be regarded as an object of worship and reverence, but she doesn't seem to have any close friends to speak of. The famed Miss Hera, however, has never taken Athena so seriously and has repeatedly challenged the limits of Athena\u2019s tolerance.

Exposing this also brought the reputation and prestige that the Pallas family had accrued over many years to sudden ruin, which even Athena herself could not escape from unscathed.\nAn unending stream of whispers like \"She's brought shame to her family\" and \"She's surely no different\" assailed Athena's ears, but she showed no sign of backing down.

Their features showed an incongruous mixture of confusion and determination, giving the piece an utterly unfinished look from any onlooker's perspective.\n\"He said it was him,\" Oceanus said, \"and that he is an unfinished work.\"\nAccording to Enlil, when he looked back on all his studies that night, he realized that he had only ever copied the work of others, so his own work never contained anything that was uniquely his. This was why, no matter how hard he tried, he could never sculpt anything with as much soul as Oceanus did. Oceanus' words made him realize that sculpting shouldn't be a mere study of technique, but rather an unearthing of something from deep inside the artist. Thus, he destroyed his works and bade his past self farewell. After this, Enlil was sent to Stellaris Academy to further his studies, bringing himself one step closer to his goals.",

With many put off by Enlil's subdued personality, a long time passed before someone willing to adopt him appeared. Having grown accustomed to this state of affairs, Enlil was somewhat bewildered when he heard that Oceanus was going to be his adoptive parent.\n\"Just thinking back on it now, it was amazing meeting my father then.\"",

When he first set foot into what seemed like a palace, he couldn't help but wonder if there had been some sort of mistake. Hearing that his adoptive father was the third judge of the Astral Council only increased his doubts. In his mind, members of the council towered high above ordinary people. It was a luxury to lay eyes on a famous sculptor, let alone one he had admired for so long. Oceanus, however, didn't assume any such air\u2014he simply informed Enlil that he would teach him the art of sculpting and then left, leaving Enlil to begin his new life with a head full of questions.\nIn the following days, Oceanus did not appear again\u2014it was as if he'd forgotten about his adoptive son. Seeing that Oceanus had no intention of restricting him, Enlil started exploring every corner of the mansion. Seeing with his own two eyes the masterpieces he had once only seen in magazines shook him deeper than the pictures ever did. Driven by curiosity, Enlil sneaked into Oceanus' studio to observe his creative process, watching as the clinking of scattering stone chips gave shape to lifelike forms. Enlil gradually became immersed in the look of intense concentration on Oceanus' face, and before he knew it, he had unconsciously stepped into the studio. It was in that moment that Enlil resolved to devote every ounce of his being to studying sculpting under Oceanus.",

For a time, Enlil believed that he was adopted for his sculpting talent, so he devoted a lot of time to sculpting. Yearning for his adoptive father's recognition, he strove for perfection in everything from studying his textbooks and reference books to his physical observations. He received a great amount of praises from others\u2014yet Oceanus was the only one to turn his nose up at Enlil's work. The harder Enlil tried, the more dissatisfied Oceanus became with him. While they appeared to have a close relationship, this distressed Enlil.\nOver the course of living with Oceanus, Enlil eventually learned of a wager that concerned him. Learning the reason for his adoption left Enlil briefly shaken. He wondered if he was in fact untalented, and grew even more uncertain of Oceanus' opinion of him. Feeling increasingly mired in stress, Enlil's studies grinded to a halt. After a few days passed in a haze, Enlil went for Oceanus while he was working and asked him for his perspective. While the third judge did not stop what he was doing, in a rare act, he did speak:\n\"What kind of work you make is up to you, but you still have a long way to go.\"\nAlthough Oceanus acted like he spoke offhandedly, Enlil quickly understood what he meant and bowed respectfully before exiting the studio. One evening after this, Enlil made a bold decision. Although he's reluctant to talk about what happened, this decision did ultimately break down the walls between them.",
        "heart_chain3": "After being adopted by Oceanus, Enlil gradually realized that his seemingly enigmatic and perfect adoptive father in fact had many flaws.\nFor example, Oceanus had no sense of how to put himself in order and often donned his formal attire incorrectly. Moreover, having no skill in cooking, the flavors he produced were... hard to describe. Finally, he was always making a complete mess of his studio, but because he's averse to letting others enter it, he'd only force himself to tidy it up when he practically couldn't move through the clutter...\nThus, Enlil began taking care of small things for Oceanus: He prepares Oceanus' breakfast before he awakes according to the week's nutrition chart, helps him dress before he travels, and cleans up his studio for him after he finishes working. He even does the cleaning and garden maintenance. And just like that, the relationship between the two seemed to be inverted, with the adopter becoming the one being cared for. After numerous failed attempts to take care of himself, Oceanus finally gave in and left it all to Enlil.",

The way Oceanus sees it, sculpting is the best vehicle to convey the vision of Ardisis.

Meanwhile, Enlil indeed only produced a few lifeless pieces, which only further dashed Oceanus' hopes.\nAfter a certain incident, however, Oceanus realized that Enlil had awoken to his true self, and from then on, he stopped withholding his knowledge from Enlil and let it flow to him unimpeded.",

When it was all over, a spirit dog in the form of Upu appeared before Anubis with the help of the Access Key's power.\nStill, the real Upu was gone, and the presence in his arms turned into an unresponsive hollow, just like his stepfather's tombstone.\nAnubis finally understood that his power would never be able to truly stop death.",

Faced with such a handsome youth, the confessor seemed to take the anonymous approach out of a lack of confidence, as if wanting to experience a futile crush.\nAnubis' chosen course of action in response made his colleagues' jaws drop\u2014he applied his case-solving mindset to meticulously gather clues to identify the sender, then earnestly returned their gift to them.\nAfter this, the women of Spec Ops formed an unspoken rule between them\u2014they would dissuade any new member from confessing her feelings to Anubis in order to spare her the pain of having their love letter publicly returned to them.",

Anubis' adoptive father is an upstanding, cordial police officer, and when Anubis felt his soul, warmth and sincerity rushed into his mind. It was from this feeling that Anubis gleaned what an ideal future looked like, as seen by a truly virtuous officer.\nPerhaps this feeling was infectious, because Anubis also began dreaming of becoming an officer that would uphold justice.",

The sun almost fell from the sky.

Though this was not a bad thing in itself, this also led to Thunder Squad subsequently becoming the \"least efficient squad\" in Aether Gazer, despite its high mission completion rates.\nAs Shu said while looking over the squad's battle records, \"I hope you can understand, Thor, that as a leader it is better that you train your team properly from the very beginning than to constantly answer for their mistakes...

Interestingly, Odin returned with a red-haired girl in her arms: Thor.\nA quick look at the current files shows Thor to be one of the more special Modifiers, given her Arrival in the Source Layer and her constant battling with the Visbanes since then.\n\"At that time, I only knew that I had to destroy them... That's what a voice told me to do. Why, you ask? Who cares!\"\nOver time, Thor accumulated tons of experience fighting the Visbanes, as well as a high level of Divine Grace due to all the time she spent in the Source Layer.\nNevertheless, Thor's personality and understanding of the world lagged behind this growth. This meant that she was unable to control her growing powers, which eventually led to the disturbance in the Source Layer...\nFollowing this incident, Odin decided to roll up her sleeves and teach Thor how to control her powers herself, and this was how Thor came to be a part of Aether Gazer.",

Now, after a period of training, Thor is able to freely control the target and energy level of each release.\nIn an emergency, Thor can even envelop herself in thunder to enhance her attacks and disappear from the enemy's view.\nUsing their gravity tech, the Cryptics created a hammer capable of storing electric power. Though the Cryptics originally designed the hammer, \"Mj\u00f6lnir,\" to be a weapon that unleashes electric strikes on the enemy, Thor seems to vastly prefer its properties as a melee weapon instead.\nAs Thor needs to discharge the excess electric charge in her once in a while, it would be better to keep a safe distance if you run into her at the training ground.",

On this day, he took out a complicated-looking puzzle lock, a problem that he gave himself in his childhood.\nRun-of-the-mill locks were no challenge even for the young Mengzhang, and so one day, he decided to add not one, but sixty-four interlocks to an existing puzzle and then try to open it. This posed to be the mother of all problems for young Mengzhang, who could only hope that he would solve it in the future. And now, in the future, he still could not find the answer. Feeling a little frustrated, he started getting a little rough with the puzzle.\nThen, in an instant, the insides of the vexing device finally surrendered to the assault of the years, and the lock simply came apart.\nMengzhang had indeed opened the lock.\nHe tidied up his hut, bade farewell to the sparrows on the trees, and left Old Town.\n\"Have you finally figured out what it is that you want to do?\"\n\"I'm just an ordinary man with no real ambition.

All these stories that she should have heard while falling asleep as a child were all so novel and interesting to her despite her age...\n\"Hmm, what an interesting story...

But as long as I am efficient, I should still be able to squeeze out some personal time for myself...\"\nIt is during this scarce \"personal time\" that Yingzhao has actually managed to build a small garden in her backyard, complete with various animals and plants.\nTaking care of so many different types of creatures often requires careful planning and execution skills, and to a certain extent, her work at Tian Lu Traders has really trained her in these aspects.\nHowever, it's a mystery to all but Yingzhao as to why she'd so \"happen\" to pass by a local park or botanical garden every time she goes on a business trip...",

After all, Yingzhao is a highly efficient and driven worker, quite unlike her demure younger sister.\nThis was because before Yingzhao joined Tian Lu Traders she'd worked multiple jobs to make a living. To ensure that she'd make the next job in time, she had to complete every job as quickly as possible.\nYingzhao's efficiency also extends outside of work. No one at Tian Lu Traders knows when Yingzhao takes her lunch because she always moves so fast, even at mealtimes.\nShe has a habit of eating convenience meals that she wolfs down in just a few mouthfuls. However, whenever Linyu comes to Laixian Hall, Yingzhao would sit down with her sister and slowly taste the dishes Linyu has brought. This is especially true when Linyu comes with \"Wensi Tofu,\" a dish that calls for a painstaking preparation process.\nAt first, Yingzhao would tell Linyu not to spend too much time on unimportant matters like this. But Linyu knew that her sister would eat the food she'd prepared anyway, so as not to put her efforts to waste, and so she always made Wensi Tofu on the sly. Over time, Yingzhao also came to accept these moments of relaxation. Although Yingzhao still believes that making complicated dishes is a waste of time, she also believes that \"a certain degree of time wasting is necessary.\" Moreover, Linyu is very happy whenever she gets to sit down with Yingzhao for a meal, which is more than enough for Yingzhao.\nHowever, Linyu, who has excellent knife skills, often reads her mechanical engineering textbooks while cutting tofu.

But little did she expect that Linyu, who'd noticed her growing distractedness, would try and do something on her own to help.\nBy the time Yingzhao received Linyu's message and rushed to the scene, the two parties were already locked in confrontation. It turned out that the goods were stolen by a gang, and Linyu had tailed them to this location to get the stolen goods back after foiling them earlier. After understanding what was going on, Yingzhao picked up an iron pipe leaning against the wall and stood in front of Linyu, even though she knew that things weren't going to end well for her.\nYingzhao never really stood a chance and was quickly knocked to the ground. But just as she was about to pass out, the figures standing over her suddenly fell one by one.\nYingzhao and Linyu were saved by Lu Wu, a member of the Tian Lu Traders security team who'd also been tracking the gang. As Yingzhao was in bad shape from the beating she took, Lu Wu took her back to Tian Lu Traders for treatment, and after hearing their story Luliang took in the sisters and even offered Yingzhao a job at Tian Lu Traders.\nOn most days, Yingzhao would practice martial arts with Lu Wu, and her favored weapon now is not the pipe but the tonfa. It was also after this incident that Yingzhao became even more worried about Linyu, and forbade her from coming in contact with anything dangerous.",

But those who know her well also know that she also has her own special hobby.\nIn the backyard of Yingzhao's home, there's a tiny little world in which one can take shelter from the greater world outside, and if you're fortunate enough to visit it, you'll find that it is full of adorable elements that are rather incongruous with the image of its owner.\nHere, you'll see delicate plants that can only be found on the ground below, as well as a large number of small creatures. These were all brought back by Yingzhao from her business trips.\n\"The environment down there is so harsh. If left alone, it may be difficult for them to survive.\"\nWhile it may be hard to imagine this sentence coming from someone as dedicated to \"efficiency\" and \"meaning\" as Yingzhao, every time she encounters one of these she would put down whatever she's working on and simply stare at the living thing like she's in a trance. According to Luliang, this happens because they remind Yingzhao of herself and her sister in the past.\nAs the number of plants and animals in her collection grew, Yingzhao gradually became more interested in taking care of them, and sometimes even went out of her way to collect unique plants. So with Linyu's help, she then built this garden in the backyard. While Yingzhao is the one responsible for the day-to-day care of the place, Linyu also lends the occasional hand.\nFor Yingzhao, who'd had to grow up too soon, too early, this garden is the rare respite for her heart.",

As she doesn't want to bother anyone, she usually just sits up in bed and listens to the insects outside her window.\nListening to the insect song rise and fall is like listening to the earth breathing.

Tian Lu would also work together with the Quad to fund the emerging but extremely risky Photon Rail train manufacturing and gravity engine manufacturing industries. Although the move was immediately unanimously opposed by the other major shareholders, Luliang was able to veto these dissenting voices.\nThis decision received strong support from countless owners of small and young businesses, and Tian Lu Traders was able to raise a staggering amount of money and very quickly reversed its decline on the stock market. The shareholders who had objected had their shares diluted and could no longer dictate the future development of the company. Tian Lu's injection of a huge amount of capital also gave Yu Jing's small and young businesses a massive shot in the arm.\nBroader developments were also in Luliang's favor: in less than two years, Xu Heng's Photon Rail train manufacturing and gravity engine manufacturing industries grew to a level comparable to Neuhansa's AGI Mecha manufacturing industry, making businesses in these trade capable of competing with the Valleyrand Family. Although Tian Lu Traders had come to almost monopolize the raw material import trade in Xu Heng, Luliang is wiling to include the smaller merchants in her pursuit of wealth.

They depleted nearly half of Tian Lu Traders' value in an instant. Superb math skills did not help Luliang to reverse the direction of these engineered trends. The mining titans even excluded Tian Lu Traders from participating in financial talks, meaning that Luliang could not tap on her eloquence, either.\nIn the face of Tian Lu Traders' imminent collapse, Luliang finally realized that certain things could not be changed, no matter how much money a person made. Thoroughly disheartened, she fled back to her adoptive parents' home in the market, away from angry shareholders and aggressive journalists. She'd turned back from the famous company president of yore into an ordinary teenage girl.\nHer adoptive parents turned away all visitors, hoping that their only daughter could enjoy the life that an ordinary girl should have before her doomed business war happened. And this was how Luliang returned to the market alleys that she grew up in, and to bargaining with the stall owners. There was also the new mala soup seller to check out... Luliang gradually learned that after the Quad had decided to shift the focus of Xu Heng's economy, the regular people of Xu Heng who were originally living in poverty became much better than before. However, the mining titans continued to monopolize various resources and the average folk could only continue to work as market vendors and in other small businesses.\nSeeing all this, Luliang finally realized that the wealth she was pursuing did not exist in the bubble-like and illusory stock market, and nor had it anything to do with the lifeless giant numbers on the stock exchange board. The wealth she was pursuing was rooted in the bargaining exchanges that occurred in the markets, in every ordinary but delicious bowl of mala soup. As incompatible as this version of wealth was with the \"high-end trades,\" it had a strength and power that far surpassed whatever was going on at the stock exchange.\nLuliang finally made up her mind: if one person cannot forge change no matter how much money they make, then let more people make more money!",
        "heart_chain3": "Xu Heng was in the midst of a major reform around the time Luliang was ten years old. By then, the people of Xu Heng had learned several lessons from previous disasters, and the Quad decided to transform Xu Heng from a resource production economy to a manufacturing economy. This transformation was also subsequently aided by the gravity tech acquired through research into Cloudsong Ore.\nLuliang foresaw a strong demand for raw materials in Xu Heng and quickly steered Tian Lu Groceries toward the raw material import trade. The company began to grow quickly. Years later, Luliang was becoming richer and richer, but she still wanted more. She moved out of the city back to where she grew up, and successfully listed Tian Lu Groceries on the stock market.\nHowever, the policy of the Quad went against the interests of the mining titans of Xu Heng who wished to see district remain a resource exporter. The magnates decided to plot against the emerging companies like Tian Lu Groceries and monopolized the freight capacity on the Photon Rail. It was at this very time that Tian Lu Groceries received a massive order. To get the goods in Yu Jing in time, the company would have no other choice but to use a long-abandoned Photon Rail line, said to have been discontinued after a horrific monster attack.\nKnowing the importance of this order to Tian Lu Groceries, Luliang ignored all objections and proceeded to escort the shipment herself. As expected, the freight train carrying the shipment encountered an \"accident\" and fell into a Source Layer fissure caused by Visbanes mid-journey, right into a Visbane ambush. As things got really tricky, Luliang's Modifier powers were finally fully awakened, and she was able to repel the Visbanes and escort the train to Yu Jing. Perhaps because she was used to thinking as a businessperson, Luliang did not think very much about the source of her Modifier powers. Instead, she racked her brain to see how she could use these powers to benefit her business. She quickly sent out false news of the freight train's loss, and at the same time she formed a security force to escort shipments on what became an \"exclusive\" Photon Rail line for the company. Thus she hoodwinked her rivals and overcame this crisis. Tian Lu Groceries subsequently expanded several times and was eventually renamed Tian Lu Traders.\nTian Lu Traders was the sole survivor among the emerging companies. The mining titans were making no pretense by then and officially started a war against Tian Lu. After their failed plot against Tian Lu Traders, the moguls tried to use their vast financial resources to bring down Tian Lu in the stock market instead. Luliang, who was clearly no shrinking violet, decided to use her capital as well as her business talents to fight these mining titans head-on.",

Not only did the use of new technologies and measures appease the people of Xu Heng, it also greatly reduced the casualty count in the Cloudsong Crisis that time. When the Astral Engine was successfully started, the crisis was fully averted. Gengchen remained solemn even as everyone else was celebrating, however, for she knew that the Astral Engine was but a temporary solution. Her top priority was to free the people of Xu Heng from the looming shadow of the Cloudsong Crisis for good.\nAfter the crisis, Gengchen would visit the various islands on behalf of the Quad to solve residents' day-to-day problems, and the Quad came to be recognized and respected by the people. As time passed, some people even came to think of Gengchen as the \"deity who saved Xu Heng.\" However, each time Gengchen heard Luliang mention this, she would just shake her head gently. She never considered herself to be a savior, and all she wanted to do was to safeguard the future of Xu Heng.",

However, the situation did not improve even after she and Xihe jointly suppressed the powerful Visbane \"Chaos\" on Nanjiao Isle. She then ventured into the Source Layer by herself, inspecting every corner of Xu Heng's Source Layer and eliminating every single threat she saw. A year of hard work later, however, the Source Layer was still in shambles, and Xu Heng's islands were still moving in an erratic manner.\nWhen Gengchen finally understood that this catastrophe might have stemmed from the world itself, she felt lost for some time. Where could she go to get the answers to all the questions in her head? But she was a member of the Quad after all, and the people of Xu Heng looked to the Quad for hope.\n\"The great river rushes forward. It circles around the mountains; it fills up the ravines, but does not cease until it ends up in the great sea. The world is always in motion, and there is eventual balance to every phenomenon. As long as we keep moving forward, one day we will find a solution to the problem.\"\n\"If 'that day' ever comes, no matter the cost...\" One day, Lingguang overheard Gengchen mumbling this to herself, then saw her looking up at the Engine without a word for a long time.",

        "heart_chain4": "Very early on, Gengchen started liking the mapo tofu from a certain restaurant for its perfect balance between spicy and umami. After Xu Heng's islands were stabilized, the restaurant re-established itself at East Banchuan Street. However, when she visited the restaurant again, Gengchen felt that the mapo tofu had become rather insipid and devoid of flavor, with only the fire remaining. But the restaurant owner told her that the recipes and cooking techniques had not changed, and that other diners continued to enjoy the dish as much as they did before. It was then Gengchen suddenly realized that the problem lay with herself.\nShe returned to the Quad and placed a spoonful of salt in her mouth. Even as the salt crystals melted on her tongue, there was no salty taste. Strangely, she was relieved by the results of this experiment. Lingguang performed an examination on her and concluded that Gengchen has lost most of her sense of taste due to the damage to her Prime Power. Moreover, her other senses had also declined to varying degrees.\nGengchen elected to withhold what was happening to her from everyone in the Quad so as not to be a burden on them, and naturally, Lingguang did not mention this to anyone else either. Instead, she'd remind Gengchen to not use too much salt or sauce whenever they were in public view, a gesture or signal that was understood between themselves.\nOf all the flavors in the world, spicy is a form of pain, and now, the only thing left that could make Gengchen's life less boring was the sensation of pain. Later on, Gengchen also fell in love with drinking tea, especially scalding hot tea. The hot water accentuated the fragrance of the tea leaves and stimulated her olfactory senses, and the boiling temperature was also another proof to her of the physical existence of the tea. For Modifiers, dining is a pastime to begin with, and this tiny sliver of entertainment and satisfaction was good enough for Gengchen.",
        "heart_chain3": "Everyone at the Quad knows that Gengchen is a big fan of calligraphy and painting. Prior to the Cloudsong Crisis, Gengchen would often pick up outstanding works for her collection while on her travels, particularly ink paintings that depicted everyday life. To her, together these paintings told the story of the changes that were happening in Xu Heng and afforded her precious glimpses into the people's lives. Furthermore, these paintings also allowed her to see the endless possibilities of Xu Heng's future.\nIn the past, during her free time Gengchen could always be found in her room admiring her collection or even creating a work herself. However, after the Cloudsong Crisis occurred, she donated a large part of her collection to be exhibited by a gallery run by Tian Lu Traders. When asked why by Luliang, Gengchen would only say that the Quad had many responsibilities, and she probably wouldn't have spare time for the collection, so why not share the works with others instead?\nThe exhibition turned out to be a major success, and Luliang visited the Quad to tell Gengchen the good news. However, she came upon an unexpected scene: there was Gengchen with a faint sheen of sweat on her forehead, struggling at her desk to put characters on paper with her brush. When she stopped writing to inspect her work, the tension in her brows betrayed her disappointment: although the characters were neatly aligned, there was no smooth flow to the calligraphy at all. Everything looked stilted, even messy. Luliang knocked on the door and entered the room, and Gengchen put away her writing implements and set out some hot tea for Luliang.\n\"Mantou, what's...\"\n\"Oh, you saw that...? Looks like the lack of practice got me. I don't think I can ever write for you the same way as I did before.\"\nLuliang's question never left the tip of her tongue and instead dissipated into nothingness in the face of Gengchen's jocular self-deprecation.",

The sky is close by, just like this\u2014you can simply reach out and grab it.\" Thoth gestured to the glass container, in which the substance glowed a faint blue.\n\"But if you grab it too hard, it will break... So it's best to keep it protected!\" \nThoth didn't know how to respond to the interjections from these \"people.\" As far as she was concerned, this was just a job. The lessons continued, but fewer and fewer students showed up.\nThree years later and after the Graytower's collapse, Thoth finds herself standing at the site where it once stood. The sky is gloomier than she's ever seen it, with only scattered rays of light managing to pierce their way through.\nThe deep blue sky seems to be little more than a half-remembered dream.",
        "heart_chain3": "Despite being posted to the Egregious Crimes Department, Thoth does not believe that investigating major crimes should take over her entire life.\nIn her spare time, she continues to read voraciously. Her preferred books are poetry anthologies and history books. This perhaps goes some way toward explaining her ever-changing, multi-faceted personality.\nAs an active member of an online book club, Thoth frequently organizes a host of reading activities. She's also a regular sight at art exhibitions.\nBy simply reading an online book review left by a club member or looking at a painting in a gallery, she's able to deduce more information about its creator than they'd probably be comfortable with.\nInterestingly enough, this passion for books and art initially started out as a way to meet mission requirements. What she used to see as a boring chore is now something she probably couldn't live without.\n\"When I retire, I'm definitely moving to Omorfies. If I had my way, I'd do it tomorrow!\"",
