My sister laughs at me for how tone deaf I sound when I sing, but the strange thing is that I'm perfectly in tune when I hum your composition. When will you be back? Whenever I look at the music stand where you compose your works, I get the feeling that I can write beautiful music, too. Unfortunately... I've never been talented in music ever since I was a child. I wonder if I've been missing you too much lately... a few days ago I even took a misstep on stage and ended up tearing my skirt! This is all your fault... When will you accompany me to the art exhibition? My friend at the Painters' Association sold me two tickets... They're showing paintings from your favorite artist Marot! Today's not a good time, though. I've been told to get my skirt mended by today. What about tomorrow? But if you can only spare time today, well, today's good too!\n\u2014Agathe\nJuly 30, 2307"

I just want to say thank you for the hard work all of you have put in to ensure a great performance!\nLetter 4: The way your actors look and what they wear on stage... it's as if you've copied the way Morgan Theater does things! The cheek!\nLetter 5: We're longtime patrons of the theater, and we've seen how the theater has been affected by the slow economy. As such, we have taken the liberty to raise some funds among ourselves, and we hope that this modest sum of money attached will be of help to the theater."

You often say that we should take good care of our instruments as if they are our own family, and that if there is ever something wrong with my French horn I could always talk ask you for the repair fee. So yesterday, I found myself standing in front of the door to your office.\nThat was how I came to hear the conversation you were having.\nThe two of you are right: A blood sacrifice is needed to start Omorfies anew.\nHowever, a great person like you should never be interrogated by the likes of the Knights of Convallaria. What you need is a blade that can carry out your will.\nAs someone who has been a friend to your acquaintance over the years, I believe that I am best suited for the job. Though I am something of a loner, I too have relationships that cannot be easily severed. I remember you saying after the performance ended yesterday that what matters most is family. You being the kind and generous person that you are, I know that once this grand ceremony is over, you will offer a small stipend to me and my gravely ill mother, so that we may have safe passage to Rostach.\n\u2014Anton"

Well, I'll make all my stage clothes myself if that means I can keep on dancing!\nJenna feels the same way, too. We've been able to talk to each other as if we're old friends even though she just joined us and is still adjusting. However, I'm sure it's only a matter of time before she gets into the groove!\nThe spotlights haven't been fixed yet and so they keep flickering... It gets a little creepy. If only I could be with him now... I always feel that I could tackle even the scariest monsters whenever I'm with him... He didn't look too good when I last saw him, though.
